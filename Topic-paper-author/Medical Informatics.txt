Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	"Don't care values in induction."	N. A. Diamantidis,Emmanouel A. Giakoumakis	1996	"Inductive learning algorithms are powerful tools for the extraction of knowledge from data. Their success in medical domains is well-known. In medical diagnosis domains and generally in real-world applications among other problems, inductive learning algorithms have to deal with unknown values. In most cases unknown values are treated as missing ones. i.e. unknown values which are related to the class of training examples, but are missing due to lack of measurements. In this paper we address the problem of don't care values, which are unknown, because they are irrelevant to the class of the examples. The distinction of don't care values and missing ones is important in medical domains. With this distinction the experts are able to relate each diagnosis to the appropriate subset of attributes. We present techniques for dealing efficiently with don't care values in the induction of decision trees. Furthermore, we examine the importance of the distinction between missing and don't care values and we investigate the existence of don't care values instead of missing ones, in medical and non-medical real-world datasets."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Concept formation vs. logistic regression: predicting death in trauma patients.	Mirsad Hadzikadic,A. Hakenewerth,Benjamin F. Bohren,J. Norton,B. Mehta,C. Andrews	1996	"This study compares two classification models used to predict survival of injured patients entering the emergency department. Concept formation is a machine learning technique that summarizes known examples/cases in the form of a tree. After the tree is constructed, it can then be used to predict the classification of new cases. Logistic regression, on the other hand, is a statistical model that allows for a quantitative relationship for a dichotomous event with several independent variables. The outcome (dependent) variable must have only two choices, e.g. does or does not occur, alive or dead. etc. The result of this model is an equation which is then used to predict the probability of class membership of a new case. The two models were evaluated on a trauma registry database composed of information on all trauma patients admitted in 1992 to a Level I trauma center. A total of 2155 records, representing all trauma patients admitted for more than 24 h or who died in the Emergency Department, were grouped into two databases as follows: (1) discharge status of 'died' (containing 151 records), and (2) any discharge status other than 'died' (containing 2004 records). Both databases contained the same variables."

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Modelling ECG signals with hidden Markov models.	A. Koski	1996	In this paper, we have studied the use of continuous probability density function hidden Markov models for the ECG signal analysis problem. Our previous work has focused on syntactic pattern recognition methods in signal processing. Hidden Markov model is basically a non-deterministic probabilistic finite state machine, which can be constructed inductively. It has been widely used in speech recognition and DNA modelling. We have found that hidden Markov models are very suitable for ECG recognition and analysis problems and that they are able to model accurately segmented ECG signals.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Machine learning in prognosis of the femoral neck fracture recovery.	Matjaz Kukar,Igor Kononenko,T. Silvester	1996	We compare the performance of several machine learning algorithms in the problem of prognostics of the femoral neck fracture recovery: the K-nearest neighbours algorithm, the semi-naive Bayesian classifier, backpropagation with weight elimination learning of the multilayered neural networks, the LFC (lookahead feature construction) algorithm, and the Assistant-I and Assistant-R algorithms for top down induction of decision trees using information gain and RELIEFF as search heuristics, respectively. We compare the prognostic accuracy and the explanation ability of different classifiers. Among the different algorithms the semi-naive Bayesian classifier and Assistant-R seem to be the most appropriate. We analyze the combination of decisions of several classifiers for solving prediction problems and show that the combined classifier improves both performance and the explanation ability.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Structure discovery in medical databases: a conceptual clustering approach.	F. A. da Veiga	1996	Clustering is an important data analysis tool for discovering structure in data sets. Although research on conceptual clustering has produced algorithms showing significant advantages over earlier numerical ones, existing methods still present some limitations regarding applicability to biomedical domains. In this paper we describe ADAGIO, a conceptual clustering algorithm combining a low-cost preordering process with a breadth-first incremental control strategy that incorporates merging and splitting operators. Experimental evaluation indicated that the algorithm achieves a good balance between structure discovery performance and computational efficiency, and demonstrated the comparative effectiveness of its missing information handling process. ADAGIO is able to handle qualitative, quantitative and mixed-type data. An application example to a cancer domain is given, where the algorithm was able to suggest interesting epidemiological interpretations.

IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging	A Novel Volumetric Feature Extraction Technique, with Applications to MR Images.	Edward A. Ashton,Kevin J. Parker,Michel J. Berg,Chang Wen Chen	1997	The in vivo morphological and volumetric analysis of biological structures is a topic which is of increasing interest in the medical community. Such an analysis requires the extraction of the feature of interest from volumetric magnetic resonance (MR), ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) scans. The difficulty of this extraction varies with the modality used and the morphology of the structure of interest, but in many cases current practice requires the manual outlining of the structure on each slice of the scanned volume-a time consuming and tedious task. We seek to provide an automated algorithm which accomplishes this task with minimal a priori knowledge and operator input and with an accuracy which is comparable to that of the current manual and semi-automated techniques.

IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging	Partial-Volume Bayesian Classification of Material Mixtures in MR Volume Data Using Voxel Histograms.	David H. Laidlaw,Kurt W. Fleischer,Alan H. Barr	1998	We present a new algorithm for identifying the distribution of different material types in volumetric datasets such as those produced with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT). Because we allow for mixtures of materials and treat voxels as regions, our technique reduces the classification artifacts that thresholding can create along boundaries between materials and is particularly useful for creating accurate geometric models and renderings from volume data. It also has the potential to make more-accurate volume measurements and classifies noisy, low-resolution data well. There are two unusual aspects to our approach. First, we assume that, due to partial-volume effects, voxels can contain more than one material, e.g., both muscle and fat; we compute the relative proportion of each material in the voxels. Second, we incorporate information from neighboring voxels into the classification process by reconstructing a continuous function, p(x), from the samples and then looking at the distribution of values that p takes on within the region of a voxel. This distribution of values is represented by a histogram taken over the region of the voxel; the mixture of materials that those values measure is identified within the voxel using a probabilistic Bayesian approach that matches the histogram by finding the mixture of materials within each voxel most likely to have created the histogram. The size of regions that we classify is chosen to match the spacing of the samples because the spacing is intrinsically related to the minimum feature size that the reconstructed continuous function can represent.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Comparing the Similarity of Time-Series Gene Expression Using Signal Processing Metrics.	Atul J. Butte,Ling Bao,Ben Y. Reis,Timothy W. Watkins,Isaac S. Kohane	2001	Many algorithms have been used to cluster genes measured by microarray across a time series. Instead of clustering, our goal was to compare all pairs of genes to determine whether there was evidence of a phase shift between them. We describe a technique where gene expression is treated as a discrete time-invariant signal, allowing the use of digital signal-processing tools, including power spectral density, coherence, and transfer gain and phase shift. We used these on a public RNA expression set of 2467 genes measured every 7 min for 119 min and found 18 putative associations. Two of these were known in the biomedical literature and may have been missed using correlation coefficients. Digital signal processing tools can be embedded and enhance existing clustering algorithms.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	High-Performance Implementation and Analysis of the Linkmap Program.	Kulin Kothari,Noé Lopez-Benitez,S. E. Poduslo	2001	Linkage analysis uses information from family pedigrees to map genes and locate disease genes on particular chromosomes. A recombination fraction denoted as θ is estimated as a measure of crossing over between two loci. Genetic linkage calculations are very time-consuming particularly for large family pedigrees, a large number of θ values, and an increased number of markers. This paper reports the implementation of a dynamic master-slave scheme for the parallelization of the Link-map program on a high-performance cluster such as the Origin 2000 (O2K) consisting of 56 R12000 processors. The Linkmap program is one of four programs in the LINKAGE/FASTLINK legacy package widely used by the medical research community. Implementations issues are addressed and results are compared with previous results on a cluster of DEC Alphas, and with the sequential execution on the O2K machine.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Medical Informatics and Bioinformatics: European Efforts to Facilitate Synergy.	Victor Maojo,Ilias Iakovidis,Fernando Martín-Sánchez,José Crespo,Casimir A. Kulikowski	2001	Over the past decade there have been several attempts to rethink the basic strategies and scope of medical informatics. Meanwhile, bioinformatics has only recently experienced a similar debate about its scientific character. Both disciplines envision the development of novel diagnostic, therapeutic, and management tools, and products for patient care. A combination of the expertise of medical informatics in developing clinical applications and the focused principles that have guided bioinformatics could create a synergy between the two areas of application. Such interaction could have a great influence on future health research and the ultimate goal, namely continuity and individualization of health care. This article summarizes current activities related to facilitating synergy between medical informatics and bioinformatics, emphasizing activities in Europe while relating them to efforts in other parts of the world. The report provides examples of the analysis that European investigators are carrying out, aiming to propose new ideas for collaborations between medical informatics and bioinformatics researchers in a variety of areas.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	"Methodology Used for ""Software for Automated Linkage in Italy"" (SALI)."	Luigino Dal Maso,Claudia Braga,Silvia Franceschi	2001	Linkage of epidemiological registries can provide cost-effective information on the associations between different diseases or exposures in the population under study and on completeness of surveillance system databases. We describe the program SALI (software for automated linkage in Italy) aimed at matching individual records from medium-sized registries (in the order of 100,000 records), where the desired outcome is to miss as few links as possible and, because of low link-likelihood (>1%), a manual revision of matched pairs is feasible. SALI, developed in CA-Clipper language, uses registry files in dBase format. It requires only name, surname, and date of birth as key fields, and it allows for spelling errors in Italian or other Latin languages through a specific algorithm. Furthermore, a double-blind procedure ensures data confidentiality. The main linkage procedure is based on four stages, two automatic ones, and two where the operator can decide through specific windows whether to accept stage-selected matches. SALI takes into account possible errors in key fields thus reducing false negatives. It was used to solve the problem of linkage between AIDS and cancer registries in Italy. It can be used with every IBM-compatible computer system, assuring uniquely high portability.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Image Understanding Methods in Biomedical Informatics and Digital Imaging.	Marek R. Ogiela,Ryszard Tadeusiewicz	2001	This paper will present new possibilities for the application of image recognition methods and AI application in biomedical informatics as well as semantically oriented analysis of 2D images of coronary arteries originating from coronography examinations. In particular this paper presents the possibilities for computer analysis and recognition of local stenoses of the lumen of coronary arteries via the application of syntactic methods of pattern recognition. Such stenoses are the result of the appearance of arteriosclerosis plaques, which in consequence lead to different forms of ischemic cardiovascular diseases. Such diseases may be seen in the form of stable or unstable disturbances of heart rhythm or infarction. Analysis of the correct morphology of these artery lumina is made possible with the application of syntactic analysis and pattern recognition methods, in particular with the attribute, context-free grammar of look-ahead LR(1) type.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Modeling Medical Prognosis: Survival Analysis Techniques.	Lucila Ohno-Machado	2001	Medical prognosis has played an increasing role in health care. Reliable prognostic models that are based on survival analysis techniques have been recently applied to a variety of domains, with varying degrees of success. In this article, we review some methods commonly used to model time-oriented data, such as Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox proportional hazards, and logistic regression, and discuss their applications in medical prognosis. Nonlinear, nonparametric models such as neural networks have increasingly been used for building prognostic models. We review their use in several medical domains and discuss different implementation strategies. Advantages and disadvantages of these methods are outlined, as well as pointers to pertinent literature.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Representing Patient Preference-Related Concepts for Inclusion in Electronic Health Records.	Cornelia M. Ruland,Suzanne Bakken	2001	"In recent years shared decision making between patients and their health care providers and the inclusion of patient preferences in patient care have been, in theory, embraced as models for good clinical practice. Patients' experiences, values, and preferences are increasingly acknowledged as important pieces of evidence for appropriate health care decision making. To effectively use information about patient preferences in patient care, this information, which is gathered through a process of preference elicitation, needs to be integrated with other types of information, e.g., diagnoses, treatments, and patient status indicators within the context of a longitudinal electronic health record. This integration requires that patient preference-related concepts be represented nonambiguously and in a manner that renders them suitable for computer rather than human processing. In this article, the authors describe important patient preference-related concepts and illustrate the use of the LOINC semantic structure as a terminology model to create fully specified names for a sample of 15 preference elicitations from 8 published research articles."

Fahmy	2001	A reliable method to reduce the noise from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals using a previously developed linear critically-sampled time-frequency transform is proposed. In addition to its low computational requirements, this transform has many theoretical advantages that make it a good candidate for NMR signal enhancement. NMR signals, in the transform domain, are concentrated in a very few number of coefficients while the noise is fairly distributed among the coefficients. Therefore, performing a thresholding technique in the transform domain significantly enhances the signal. Comparison with other noise reduction techniques used for the same purpose showed that this technique has superior performance thus confirming the theoretical expectations.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	An expert system for the evaluation of EDSS in multiple sclerosis.	Mauro Gaspari,Gianluigi Roveda,Cinzia Scandellari,Sergio Stecchi	2002	Multiple Sclerosis is still an unsolved disease and although several advances have been achieved in the last few years some problems such as the ethiology and the prognostic criteria are unknown or do still not have a satisfying solution. Several experimental trials of therapy in multiple sclerosis are in course in order to discover a successful treatment. Most of these experiments use a clinical rating scale named EDSS as evaluation tool for the effects of drugs. This scale is defined by a set of rules written in english which provide a numerical quantification of the neurological examination. Althougth EDSS has been widely used for almost 20 years, its application still depends on the interpretation of the neurologist which performs the neurological examination, and many applications of the scale done by different neurologist on the same patient can give different results. This is a serious problem for international trials because they lack of a reliable measure of the effects of drugs. Here we present an expert system for the automatic evaluation of EDSS in multiple sclerosis which has been developed to overcome this problem. The expert system exploits an explicit representation of EDSS rules, it is able to explain its conclusions, and it provides a revision tool to support the user if no satifying solution can be reached. Using this expert system clinical trials based on EDSS can benefit of a more reliable evaluation tool providing more valuable results.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Neural network-based system for early keratoconus detection from corneal topography.	P. Agostino Accardo,Stefano Pensiero	2002	Some automatic methods have been proposed to identify keratoconus from corneal maps; among these methods, neural networks have proved to be useful. However, the identification of the early cases of this ocular disease remains a problem from both a diagnostic and a screening point of view. Another problem is whether a keratoconus screening must be performed taking into account both eyes of the same subject or each eye separately; hitherto, neural networks have only been used in the second alternative. In order to examine the differences of the two screening alternatives in terms of discriminative capability, several combinations of the number of input, hidden and output nodes and of learning rates have been examined in this study. The best results have been achieved by using as input the parameters of both eyes of the same subject and as output the three categories of clinical classification (normal, keratoconus, other alterations) for each subject, a low number of neurons in the hidden layer (lower than 10) and a learning rate of 0.1. In this case a global sensitivity of 94.1% (with a keratoconus sensitivity of 100%) in the test set as well as a global specificity of 97.6% (98.6% for keratoconus alone) have been reached.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Measuring agreement in medical informatics reliability studies.	George Hripcsak,Daniel F. Heitjan	2002	"Agreement measures are used frequently in reliability studies that involve categorical data. Simple measures like observed agreement and specific agreement can reveal a good deal about the sample. Chance-corrected agreement in the form of the kappa statistic is used frequently based on its correspondence to an intraclass correlation coefficient and the ease of calculating it, but its magnitude depends on the tasks and categories in the experiment. It is helpful to separate the components of disagreement when the goal is to improve the reliability of an instrument or of the raters. Approaches based on modeling the decision making process can be helpful here, including tetrachoric correlation, polychoric correlation, latent trait models, and latent class models. Decision making models can also be used to better understand the behavior of different agreement metrics. For example, if the observed prevalence of responses in one of two available categories is low, then there is insufficient information in the sample to judge raters' ability to discriminate cases, and kappa may underestimate the true agreement and observed agreement may overestimate it."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Reconstruction of the genetic regulatory dynamics of the rat spinal cord development: Local Invariants approach.	Yuriy Fofanov,B. Montgomery Pettitt	2002	Recently, many attempts have been made to describe the gene expression temporal dynamics by using systems of differential equations. This is fraught with difficulty, given the current experimental level of understanding. Another way to extract useful information regarding regulation in genetic networks can be provided by our method of Incomplete Modeling using Local Invariants, although at the price of not being able to construct a complete model of the whole system. In this approach we are looking for a set of simple models describing the algebraic or differential relations among just a few variables, genes in this case, which fit the experimental data with the required accuracy. In the present work, we apply this method to gene expression time profiles of 112 genes from rat spinal cord development experiments. We found that many different types of Local Invariants exist in this dataset. Moreover, some isolated self-contained subsystems, whose behavior can be described by closed systems of differential equations, were also found.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Revising regulatory networks: from expression data to linear causal models.	Stephen D. Bay,Jeff Shrager,Andrew Pohorille,Pat Langley	2002	Discovering the complex regulatory networks that govern mRNA expression is an important but difficult problem. Many current approaches use only expression data from microarrays to infer the likely network structure. However, this ignores much existing knowledge because for a given organism and system under study, a biologist may already have a partial model of gene regulation. We propose a method for revising and improving these initial models, which may be incomplete or partially incorrect, with expression data. We demonstrate our approach by revising a model of photosynthesis regulation proposed by a biologist for Cyanobacteria. Applied to wild type expression data, our system suggested several modifications consistent with biological knowledge. Applied to a mutant strain, our system correctly modified the disabled gene. Power experiments with synthetic data that indicate that reliable revision is feasible even with a small number of samples.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Information extraction for enhanced access to disease outbreak reports.	Ralph Grishman,Silja Huttunen,Roman Yangarber	2002	Document search is generally based on individual terms in the document. However, for collections within limited domains it is possible to provide more powerful access tools. This paper describes a system designed for collections of reports of infectious disease outbreaks. The system, Proteus-BIO, automatically creates a table of outbreaks, with each table entry linked to the document describing that outbreak; this makes it possible to use database operations such as selection and sorting to find relevant documents. Proteus-BIO consists of a Web crawler which gathers relevant documents; an information extraction engine which converts the individual outbreak events to a tabular database; and a database browser which provides access to the events and, through them, to the documents. The information extraction engine uses sets of patterns and word classes to extract the information about each event. Preparing these patterns and word classes has been a time-consuming manual operation in the past, but automated discovery tools now make this task significantly easier. A small study comparing the effectiveness of the tabular index with conventional Web search tools demonstrated that users can find substantially more documents in a given time period with Proteus-BIO.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Formal nursing terminology systems: a means to an end.	Nicholas R. Hardiker,Suzanne Bakken,Anne Casey,Derek Hoy	2002	In response to the need to support diverse and complex information requirements, nursing has developed a number of different terminology systems. The two main kinds of systems that have emerged are enumerative systems and combinatorial systems, although some systems have characteristics of both approaches. Differences in the structure and content of terminology systems, while useful at a local level, prevent effective wider communication, information sharing, integration of record systems, and comparison of nursing elements of healthcare information at a more global level. Formal nursing terminology systems present an alternative approach. This paper describes a number of recent initiatives and explains how these emerging approaches may help to augment existing nursing terminology systems and overcome their limitations through mediation. The development of formal nursing terminology systems is not an end in itself and there remains a great deal of work to be done before success can be claimed. This paper presents an overview of the key issues outstanding and provides recommendations for a way forward.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Visualization and evaluation of clusters for exploratory analysis of gene expression data.	Ju-Han Kim,Isaac S. Kohane,Lucila Ohno-Machado	2002	Clustering algorithms have been shown to be useful to explore large-scale gene expression profiles. Visualization and objective evaluation of clusters are two important considerations when users are selecting different clustering algorithms, but they are often overlooked. The developments of a framework and software tools that implement comprehensive data visualization and objective measures of cluster quality are crucial In this paper, we describe a theoretical framework and formalizations for consistently developing clustering algorithms. A new clustering algorithm was developed within the proposed framework. We demonstrate that a theoretically sound principle can be uniformly applied to the developments of cluster-optimization function, comprehensive data-visualization strategy, and objective cluster-evaluation measures as well as actual implementation of the principle. Cluster consistency and quality measures of the algorithm are rigorously evaluated against those of popular clustering algorithms for gene expression data analysis (K-means and self-organizing maps), in four data sets, yielding promising results.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The structure of science information.	Zellig S. Harris	2002	The organization of information within science can be investigated in a principled way through analysis of science language. The restricted use of language in science enables description of the informational structure of science and of particular subfields, with strong similarities to structures in mathematics and programming languages. This result rests on decades of research into the relation between form and content in language, based on an information-theoretic approach to the structure of information. Examples are provided from immunology and the social sciences. Practical applications include storage of science information in databases, indexing the literature, and identification and resolution of controversy.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The potential of latent semantic analysis for machine grading of clinical case summaries.	Walter Kintsch	2002	Objective: This paper introduces latent semantic analysis (LSA), a machine learning method for representing the meaning of words, sentences, and texts. LSA induces a high-dimensional semantic space from reading a very large amount of texts. The meaning of words and texts can be represented as vectors in this space and hence can be compared automatically and objectively. Psychological theory: A generative theory of the mental lexicon based on LSA is described. The word vectors LSA constructs are context free, and each word, irrespective of how many meanings or senses it has, is represented by a single vector. However, when a word is used in different contexts, context appropriate word senses emerge. Current applications: Several applications of LSA to educational software are described, involving the ability of LSA to quickly compare the content of texts, such as an essay written by a student and a target essay. Potential medical applications: An LSA-based software tool is sketched for machine grading of clinical case summaries written by medical students.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Computational selection of distinct class- and subclass-specific gene expression signatures.	Pierre R. Bushel,Hisham Hamadeh,Lee Bennett,James Green,Alan Ableson,Stephen Misener,Cynthia A. Afshari,Richard S. Paules	2002	In this investigation we used statistical methods to select genes with expression profiles that partition classes and subclasses of biological samples. Gene expression data corresponding to liver samples from rats treated for 24 h with an enzyme inducer (phenobarbital) or a peroxisome proliferator (clofibrate, gemfibrozil or Wyeth 14,643) were subjected to a modified Z-score test to identify gene outliers and a binomial distribution to reduce the probability of detecting genes as differentially expressed by chance. Hierarchical clustering of 238 statistically valid differentially expressed genes partitioned class-specific gene expression signatures into groups that clustered samples exposed to the enzyme inducer or to peroxisome proliferators. Using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and linear discriminant analysis methods we identified single genes as well as coupled gene expression profiles that separated the phenobarbital from the peroxisome proliferator treated samples and discerned the fibrate (gemfibrozil and clofibrate) subclass of peroxisome proliferators. A comparison of genes ranked by ANOVA with genes assessed as significant by mixed linear models analysis [J. Comput. Biol. 8 (2001) 625] or ranked by information gain revealed good congruence with the top 10 genes from each statistical method in the contrast between phenobarbital and peroxisome proliferators expression profiles. We propose building upon a classification regimen comprised of analysis of replicate data, outlier diagnostics and gene selection procedures to utilize cDNA microarray data to categorize subclasses of samples exposed to pharmacologic agents.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Paraphrasing for condensation in journal abstracting.	Richard I. Kittredge	2002	"When authors of empirical science articles write abstracts, they employ a wide variety of distinct linguistic operations which interact to condense and rephrase a subset of sentences from the source text. An on-going comparison of biological and biomedical journal articles with their author-written abstracts is providing a basis for a more linguistically detailed model of abstract derivation using syntactic representations of selected source sentences. The description makes use of rich dictionary information to formulate paraphrasing rules of differing degrees of generality, including some which are sublanguage-specific, and others which appear valid in several languages when formulated using ""lexical functions"" to express important semantic relationships between lexical items. Some paraphrase operations may use both lexical functions and rhetorical relations between sentences to reformulate larger chunks of text in a concise abstract sentence. The descriptive framework is computable and utilizes existing linguistic resources."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A dynamic approach to mapping coordinates between microplates and microarrays.	Kei-Hoi Cheung,Janet Hager,Kenneth Nelson,Kevin White,Yuli Li,Michael Snyder,Kenneth R. Williams,Perry L. Miller	2002	The retrieval of useful data from spotted microarray slides requires keeping track of which microplate wells and DNA sample corresponds to each spot on each array slide. Existing approaches are closely coupled with the type of arrayer in use and are computer operating-system-specifc. To support the microarray researcher community at large who use different arrayers and computer platforms, increased flexibility, generality, and portability of these approaches are required. In this paper, we describe a general algorithm that correlates the well positions of DNA samples in each microplate to the positions of the spots on each array slide. Based on this algorithm, we have implemented a flexible and platform-independent program named MicroArray Convolutor (MAC) that provides a Web solution allowing the user to: (a) import a text file that identifies the DNA samples and their well locations, (b) select a transformation method that converts data in 96-well plate format into 384-well plate format, and (c) specify the output format of the array lists dependant on the configuration of the array platform as well as the downstream analysis software chosen for the array. MAC and its source code can be accessed via the following Web address: http://ymd.med.yale.edu/ kei-cgi/kc_mac_dev8.pl.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Rutabaga by any other name: extracting biological names.	Lynette Hirschman,Alexander A. Morgan,Alexander S. Yeh	2002	As the pace of biological research accelerates, biologists are becoming increasingly reliant on computers to manage the information explosion. Biologists communicate their research findings by relying on precise biological terms; these terms then provide indices into the literature and across the growing number of biological databases. This article examines emerging techniques to access biological resources through extraction of entity names and relations among them. Information extraction has been an active area of research in natural language processing and there are promising results for information extraction applied to news stories, e.g., balanced precision and recall in the 93-95% range for identifying person, organization and location names. But these results do not seem to transfer directly to biological names, where results remain in the 75-80% range. Multiple factors may be involved, including absence of shared training and test sets for rigorous measures of progress, lack of annotated training data specific to biological tasks, pervasive ambiguity of terms, frequent introduction of new terms, and a mismatch between evaluation tasks as defined for news and real biological problems. We present evidence from a simple lexical matching exercise that illustrates some specific problems encountered when identifying biological names. We conclude by outlining a research agenda to raise performance of named entity tagging to a level where it can be used to perform tasks of biological importance.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Information extraction from biomedical text.	Jerry R. Hobbs	2002	Information extraction is the process of scanning text for information relevant to some interest, including extracting entities, relations, and events. It requires deeper analysis than key word searches, but its aims fall short of the very hard and long-term problem of full text understanding. Information extraction represents a midpoint on this spectrum, where the aim is to capture structured information without sacrificing feasibility. One of the key ideas in this technology is to separate processing into several stages, in cascaded finite-state transducers. The earlier stages recognize smaller linguistic objects and work in a largely domain-independent fashion. The later stages take these linguistic objects as input and find domain-dependent patterns among them. There are now initial efforts to apply this technology to biomedical text. In other domains, the technology plateaued at about 60% recall and precision. Even if applications to biomedical text do no better than this, they could still prove to be of immense help to curatorial activities.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Logistic regression and artificial neural network classification models: a methodology review.	Stephan Dreiseitl,Lucila Ohno-Machado	2002	Logistic regression and artificial neural networks are the models of choice in many medical data classification tasks. In this review, we summarize the differences and similarities of these models from a technical point of view, and compare them with other machine learning algorithms. We provide considerations useful for critically assessing the quality of the models and the results based on these models. Finally, we summarize our findings on how quality criteria for logistic regression and artificial neural network models are met in a sample of papers from the medical literature.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Automated enhancement of description logic-defined terminologies to facilitate mapping to ICD9-CM.	Peter L. Elkin,Steven H. Brown	2002	Compositional (post-coordinated) terminologies are one potential solution to the problem of content completeness. However, they have the potential to render data incomparable. For computers to determine that compositional expressions are comparable, the relations between the composed components that are understood implicitly by human readers must be represented explicitly for computer manipulation. We discuss a technique for discovering and formalizing the implicit semantic relationships in two vocabularies: the International Classification of Disease Version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM), and SNOMED-Reference Terminology (SNOMED-RT). The results of this technique are used to augment the existing SNOMED-RT relation ontology [1], which is a necessary step in automated concept mapping between systems. The reference terminology must contain all the semantics implicit in the classification in order to map concepts between the two representations. We also provide an explicit representation of the implied semantics of ICD9-CM. This tabulation will be useful for other knowledge engineering efforts involving ICD9-CM.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Two biomedical sublanguages: a description based on the theories of Zellig Harris.	Carol Friedman,Pauline Kra,Andrey Rzhetsky	2002	"Natural language processing (NLP) systems have been developed to provide access to the tremendous body of data and knowledge that is available in the biomedical domain in the form of natural language text. These NLP systems are valuable because they can encode and amass the information in the text so that it can be used by other automated processes to improve patient care and our understanding of disease processes and treatments. Zellig Harris proposed a theory of sublanguage that laid the foundation for natural language processing in specialized domains. He hypothesized that the informational content and structure form a specialized language that can be delineated in the form of a sublanguage grammar. The grammar can then be used by a language processor to capture and encode the salient information and relations in text. In this paper, we briefly summarize his language and sublanguage theories. In addition, we summarize our prior research, which is associated with the sublanguage grammars we developed for two different biomedical domains. These grammars illustrate how Harris' theories provide a basis for the development of language processing systems in the biomedical domain. The two domains and their associated sublanguages discussed are: the clinical domain, where the text consists of patient reports, and the biomolecular domain, where the text consists of complete journal articles."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Comparative genomics approaches to study organism similarities and differences.	Liping Wei,Yueyi Liu,Inna Dubchak,John Shon,John Park	2002	Comparative genomics is a large-scale, holistic approach that compares two or more genomes to discover the similarities and differences between the genomes and to study the biology of the individual genomes. Comparative studies can be performed at different levels of the genomes to obtain multiple perspectives about the organisms. We discuss in detail the type of analyses that offer significant biological insights in the comparisons of (1) genome structure including overall genome statistics, repeats, genome rearrangement at both DNA and gene level, synteny, and breakpoints; (2) coding regions including gene content, protein content, orthologs, and paralogs; and (3) noncoding regions including the prediction of regulatory elements. We also briefly review the currently available computational tools in comparative genomics such as algorithms for genome-scale sequence alignment, gene identification, and nonhomology-based function prediction.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The epidemiology of liver disease in Tayside database: a population-based record-linkage study.	Douglas T. Steinke,Tanya L. Weston,Andrew D. Morris,Thomas M. MacDonald,John F. Dillon	2002	Background. The true incidence and prevalence of liver disease is difficult to ascertain because there are few, if any, population-based registers of liver disease available to ensure proper case and comparator selection. The epidemiology of liver disease in Tayside (ELDIT) is a specially built register of liver disease for a well-defined geographical area of Scotland.Aims. This paper describes the electronic linkage of multiple data sources to form ELDIT and provides initial results from the database.Patients. All subjects resident in Tayside and registered with a general practitioner in the study period 1980-1999, approximately 400,000 people.Methods. Electronic record-linkage techniques were employed to include anonymised data from primary and secondary sources. Hospital admissions, dispensed medication, and laboratory results from immunology, virology, and biochemistry were used to identify cases of liver disease. Diagnostic algorithms were used to verify and classify subjects with liver disease. A validation of the algorithms against the clinical diagnosis was used to determine the measure of agreement (true positive rate) of ELDIT.Results. At present approximately 10,000 subjects have been identified with liver disease or abnormal liver function. The data set is nearing completion with cases of rarer liver disease being identified last. Incidence densities for the population were calculated. From the validation study, agreement between electronic and clinical diagnosis was 0.98 and positive predictive value was 0.83 showing electronic diagnostic algorithms are sensitive enough to identify liver disease using para-clinical data.Conclusions. ELDIT demonstrates how clinical information can be harnessed electronically to provide a better understanding of liver disease in a population.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Ethical issues in public health informatics: implications for system design when sharing geographic information.	Christina Ölvingson,Jonas Hallberg,Toomas Timpka,Kent Lindqvist	2002	Public health programs today constitute a multi-professional inter-organizational environment, where both health service and other organizations are involved. Developing information systems, including the IT security measures needed to suit this complex context, is a challenge. To ensure that all involved organizations work together towards a common goal, i.e., promotion of health, an intuitive strategy would be to share information freely in these programs. However, in practice it is seldom possible to realize this ideal scenario. One reason may be that ethical issues are often ignored in the system development process. This investigation uses case study methods to explore ethical obstacles originating in the shared use of geographic health information in public health programs and how this affects the design of information systems. Concerns involving confidentiality caused by geographically referenced health information and influences of professional and organizational codes are discussed. The experience presented shows that disregard of ethical issues can result in a prolonged development process for public health information systems. Finally, a theoretical model of design issues based on the case study results is presented.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Automatically identifying gene/protein terms in MEDLINE abstracts.	Hong Yu,Vasileios Hatzivassiloglou,Andrey Rzhetsky,W. John Wilbur	2002	"Motivation. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used to extract information automatically from computer-readable literature. In biology, the identification of terms corresponding to biological substances (e.g., genes and proteins) is a necessary step that precedes the application of other NLP systems that extract biological information (e.g., protein-protein interactions, gene regulation events, and biochemical pathways). We have developed GPmarkup (for ""gene/protein-full name mark up""), a software system that automatically identifies gene/protein terms (i.e., symbols or full names) in MEDLINE abstracts. As a part of marking up process, we also generated automatically a knowledge source of paired gene/protein symbols and full names (e.g., LARD for lymphocyte associated receptor of death) from MEDLINE. We found that many of the pairs in our knowledge source do not appear in the current GenBank database. Therefore our methods may also be used for automatic lexicon generation.Results. GPmarkup has 73% recall and 93% precision in identifying and marking up gene/protein terms in MEDLINE abstracts.Availability: A random sample of gene/protein symbols and full names and a sample set of marked up abstracts can be viewed at http://www.cpmc.columbia.edu/homepages/yuh9001/GPmarkup/.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Representations of health concepts: a cognitive perspective.	Jiajie Zhang	2002	"Objective: This paper studies the differences between controlled medical vocabularies that are designed as external artifacts and the mental concepts that are inside users' heads and used by users for reasoning, decision making, diagnosis, and treatment. Design: The major theories of concept representations developed in cognitive science were reviewed, analyzed, and compared with the major controlled medical vocabularies developed in medicine. Results: It was found that there are significant mismatches between controlled medical vocabularies that are designed as external artifacts and the mental concepts that are inside users' heads and used by users for reasoning, decision making, diagnosis, and treatment. Conclusions: Controlled medical vocabularies should be designed with systematical considerations of the cognitive structures and processes of the users. Without such considerations, the designed vocabularies will not be appropriate for people. because they are hard to use, although they may or may not be appropriate for machine processing."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Evidence-based careflow management systems: the case of post-stroke rehabilitation.	Silvia Panzarasa,S. Maddè,Silvana Quaglini,Caterina Pistarini,Mario Stefanelli	2002	"The activities of a care providers' team need to be coordinated within a process properly designed on the basis of available best practice medical knowledge. It requires a rethinking of the management of care processes within health care organizations. The current workflow technology seems to offer the most convenient solution to build such cooperative systems. However, some of its present weaknesses still require an intense research effort to find solutions allowing its exploitation in real medical practice. This paper presents an approach to design and build evidence-based careflow management systems, which can be viewed as components of a knowledge management infrastructure each health care organization should be provided with to increase its performance in delivering high quality care by efficiently exploiting the available knowledge resources. The post-stroke rehabilitation process has been taken as a challenging care problem to assess our methodology for designing and developing careflow management systems. Then a system was co-developed with a team of rehabilitation professionals who will be committed to use it in their daily work. The system's main goal is to deliver a full array of rehabilitation services provided by an interdisciplinary team. They are related to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from rehabilitation, manage a rehabilitation treatment plan, and monitor progress both during rehabilitation and after return to a community residence. A model of the rehabilitation process was derived from an international guideline and adapted to the local organization of work. It involves different organizational units, such as wards, rehabilitation units, clinical laboratories, and imaging services. Several organizational agents work within them and play one or more roles. Each role is defined by the goals' set that she/he must fulfill. Special effort has been given to the design and development of a knowledge-based system for managing exceptions, which may occur in daily medical work as any deviation from the normal flow of activities. It allows either avoiding or recovering automatically from expected exceptions. When they are not expected, organizational agents, with enough power to do that, are allowed to modify the scheduled flow of activities for an individual patient under the only constraint of justifying their decision. After an intensive testing in a research laboratory, the system is now in the process of being transferred in a real working setting with the full support of its future users."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	"Patients' and physicians' understanding of health and biomedical concepts: relationship to the design of EMR systems."	Vimla L. Patel,José F. Arocha,André Kushniruk	2002	"Objective: The aim of this paper is to examine knowledge organization and reasoning strategies involved in physician-patient communication and to consider how these are affected by the use of computer tools, in particular, electronic medical record (EMR) systems. Design: In the first part of the paper, we summarize results from a study in which patients were interviewed before their interactions with physicians and where physician-patient interactions were recorded and analyzed to evaluate patients' and physicians' understanding of the patient problem. We give a detailed presentation of one of such interaction, with characterizations of physician and patient models. In a second set of studies, the contents of both paper and EMRs were compared and in addition, physician-patient interactions (involving the use of EMR technology) were video recorded and analyzed to assess physicians' information gathering and knowledge organization for medical decision-making. Results: Physicians explained the patient problems in terms of causal pathophysiological knowledge underlying the disease (disease model), whereas patients explained them in terms of narrative structures of illness (illness model). The data-driven nature of the traditional physician-patient interaction allows physicians to capture the temporal flow of events and to document key aspects of the patients' narratives. Use of electronic medical records was found to influence the way patient data were gathered, resulting in information loss and disruption of temporal sequence of events in assessing patient problem. Conclusions: The physician-patient interview allows physicians to capture crucial aspects of the patient's illness model, which are necessary for understanding the problem from the patients' perspective. Use of computer-based patient record technology may lead to a loss of this relevant information. As a consequence, designers of such systems should take into account information relevant to the patient comprehension of medical problems, which will influence their compliance."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Emerging paradigms of cognition in medical decision-making.	Vimla L. Patel,David R. Kaufman,José F. Arocha	2002	"The limitations of the classical or traditional paradigm of decision research are increasingly apparent, even though there has been a substantial body of empirical research on medical decision-making over the past 40 years. As decision-support technology continues to proliferate in medical settings, it is imperative that ""basic science"" decision research develop a broader-based and more valid foundation for the study of medical decision-making as it occurs in the natural setting. This paper critically reviews both traditional and recent approaches to medical decision making, considering the integration of problem-solving and decision-making research paradigms, the role of conceptual knowledge in decision-making, and the emerging paradigm of naturalistic decision-making. We also provide an examination of technology-mediated decision-making. Expanding the scope of decision research will better enable us to understand optimal decision processes, suitable coping mechanisms under suboptimal conditions, the development of expertise in decision-making, and ways in which decision-support technology can successfully mediate decision processes."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Hierarchical data security in a Query-By-Example interface for a shared database.	Merwyn G. Taylor	2002	Whenever a shared database resource, containing critical patient data, is created, protecting the contents of the database is a high priority goal. This goal can be achieved by developing a Query-By-Example (QBE) interface, designed to access a shared database, and embedding within the QBE a hierarchical security module that limits access to the data. The security module ensures that researchers working in one clinic do not get access to data from another clinic. The security can be based on a flexible taxonomy structure that allows ordinary users to access data from individual clinics and super users to access data from all clinics [1]. All researchers submit queries through the same interface and the security module processes the taxonomy and user identifiers to limit access. Using this system, two different users with different access rights can submit the same query and get different results thus reducing the need to create different interfaces for different clinics and access rights.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The cohesive metaschema: a higher-level abstraction of the UMLS Semantic Network.	Yehoshua Perl,Zong Chen,Michael Halper,James Geller,Li Zhang,Yi Peng	2002	The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) joins together a group of established medical terminologies in a unified knowledge representation framework. Two major resources of the UMLS are its Metathesaurus, containing a large number of concepts, and the Semantic Network (SN), containing semantic types and forming an abstraction of the Metathesaurus. However, the SN itself is large and complex and may still be difficult to view and comprehend. Our structural partitioning technique partitions the SN into structurally uniform sets of semantic types based on the distribution of the relationships within the SN. An enhancement of the structural partition results in cohesive, singly rooted sets of semantic types. Each such set is named after its root which represents the common nature of the group. These sets of semantic types are represented by higher-level components called meta-semantic types. A network, called a metaschema, which consists of the meta-semantic types connected by hierarchical and semantic relationships is obtained and provides an abstract view supporting orientation to the SN. The metaschema is utilized to audit the UMLS classifications. We present a set of graphical views of the SN based on the metaschema to help in user orientation to the SN. A study compares the cohesive metaschema to metaschemas derived semantically by UMLS experts.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A variance-based measure of inter-rater agreement in medical databases.	Håkan Petersson,Hans Gill,Hans Åhlfeldt	2002	The increasing use of encoded medical data requires flexible tools for data quality assessment. Existing methods are not always adequate, and this paper proposes a new metric for inter-rater agreement of aggregated diagnostic data. The metric, which is applicable in prospective as well as retrospective coding studies, quantifies the variability in the coding scheme, and the variation can be differentiated in categories and in coders. Five alternative definitions were compared in a set of simulated coding situations and in the context of mortality statistics. Two of them were more effective, and the choice between them must be made according to the situation. The metric is more powerful for larger numbers of coded cases, and Type I errors are frequent when coding situations include different numbers of cases. We also show that it is difficult to interpret the meaning of variation when the structures of the compared coding schemes differ.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Developing, implementing, and evaluating decision support systems for shared decision making in patient care: a conceptual model and case illustration.	Cornelia M. Ruland,Suzanne Bakken	2002	"The importance of including patient preferences in decisions regarding their care has received increased emphasis over recent years. Medical informatics can play an important role in improving patient-centered care by developing decision support systems to support the inclusion of patient preferences in clinical decision making. However, development of such systems is a complex task that requires the integration of knowledge from four major research areas: (1) the clinical domain, for understanding of the decision problem, (2) decision science and research on shared decision making, to provide the theoretical underpinnings and techniques for eliciting patient preferences; (3) medical informatics, to provide the technology and algorithms for the collection, processing, structure, presentation and integration of patient preferences into patient care; and (4) organizational kuowledge, to adapt the decision support system to the practices and work flows of clinicians and the organizational and professional context of the clinical practice settings. This paper describes a conceptual model comprising eight key components that are important to be considered in the development, implementation, and evaluation of decision support systems for shared decision making in patient care. The example of CHOICE, a decision support system to assist nurses in eliciting and integrating rehabilitation patients' preferences for functional performance in patient care is used to illustrate the eight components."

Mohamed Sammouda,Rachid Sammouda,Noboru Niki,Naohito Yamaguchi,Noriyuki Moriyama	2002	"In this paper, we propose a methodology (in the form of a software package) for automatic extraction of the cancerous nuclei in lung pathological color images. We first segment the images using an unsupervised Hopfield artificial neural network classifier and we label the segmented image based on chromaticity features and histogram analysis of the RGB color space components of the raw image. Then, we fill the holes inside the extracted nuclei regions based on the maximum drawable circle algorithm. All corrected nuclei regions are then classified into normal and cancerous using diagnostic rules formulated with respect to the rules used by experimented pathologist. The proposed method provides quantitative results in diagnosing a lung pathological image set of 16 cases that are comparable to an expert's diagnosis."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Characteristic attributes in cancer microarrays.	Indra Neil Sarkar,Paul J. Planet,T. E. Bael,S. E. Stanley,Mark Siddall,Robert DeSalle,David H. Figurski	2002	"Rapid advances in genome sequencing and gene expression microarray technologies are providing unprecedented opportunities to identify specific genes involved in complex biological processes, such as development, signal transduction, and disease. The vast amount of data generated by these technologies has presented new challenges in bioinformatics. To help organize and interpret microarray data, new and efficient computational methods are needed to: (1) distinguish accurately between different biological or clinical categories (e.g., malignant vs. benign), and (2) identify specific genes that play a role in determining those categories. Here we present a novel and simple method that exhaustively scans microarray data for unambiguous gene expression patterns. Such patterns of data can be used as the basis for classification into biological or clinical categories. The method, termed the Characteristic Attribute Organization System (CAOS), is derived from fundamental precepts in systematic biology. In CAOS we define two types of characteristic attributes ('pure' and 'private') that may exist in gene expression microarray data. We also consider additional attributes ('compound') that are composed of expression states of more than one gene that are not characteristic on their own. CAOS was tested on three well-known cancer DNA microarray data sets for its ability to classify new microarray samples. We found CAOS to be a highly accurate and robust class prediction technique. In addition, CAOS identified specific genes, not emphasized in other analyses, that may be crucial to the biology of certain types of cancer. The success of CAOS in this study has significant implications for basic research and the future development of reliable methods for clinical diagnostic tools."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Evolutionary partial differential equations for biomedical image processing.	Alessandro Sarti,Karol Mikula,Fiorella Sgallari,Claudio Lamberti	2002	We are presenting here a model for processing space-time image sequences and applying them to 3D echo-cardiography. The non-linear evolutionary equations filter the sequence with keeping space-time coherent structures. They have been developed using ideas of regularized Perona-Malik an-isotropic diffusion and geometrical diffusion of mean curvature flow type (Malladi-Sethian), combined with Galilean invariant movie multi-scale analysis of Alvarez et al. A discretization of space-time filtering equations by means of finite volume method is discussed in detail. Computational results in processing of 3D echo-cardiographic sequences obtained by rotational acquisition technique and by real-time 3D echo volumetrics acquisition technique are presented. Quantitative error estimation is also provided.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Archimedes: a new model for simulating health care systems--the mathematical formulation.	Leonard Schlessinger,David M. Eddy	2002	"This paper designs an object-oriented, continuous-time, full simulation model for addressing a wide range of clinical, procedural, administrative, and financial decisions in health care at a high level of biological, clinical, and administrative detail. The full model has two main parts, which with some simplification can be designated ""physiology models"" and ""models of care processes."" The models of care processes, although highly detailed, are mathematically straightforward. However, the mathematics that describes human biology, diseases, and the effects of interventions are more difficult. This paper describes the mathematical formulation and methods for deriving equations, for a variety of different sources of data. Although Archimedes was originally designed for health care applications, the formulation, and equations are general and can be applied to many natural systems."

IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging	A MAP Framework for Tag Line Detection in SPAMM Data Using Markov Random Fields on the B-Spline Solid.	Yasheng Chen,Amir A. Amini	2002	Magnetic resonance (MR) tagging is a technique for measuringheart deformations through creation of a stripe grid pattern on cardiac images. Typically, sets of tag surfaces are encoded in the tissue appearing as dark lines on 2D images.The B-spline solid model for tagged MRI has the ad-vantage of tracking myocardial tissue with material coordinates. This makes it an effective model in the analysis of heart deformation. In this paper, we present a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) framework for detecting tags with a markov random field (MRF) defined on a sampled B-spline solid model. We formulate the tag tracking problem as MAP estimation, finding the optimal solid for the tag features present in the current image set given an initial solid for the previous frame. The framework also allows the parameters of the solid model, number of knots, and spline order to be adjusted. In this approach, fitting can start with a solid withless knots and lower spline order, and proceed to one with more knots and/or higher order to achieve more accuracy. The approach has been validated on two sets of in-vivo heart data.

IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging	HAMMER: Heirarchical Attribute Matching Mechanism for Elastic Registration.	Dinggang Shen,Christos Davatzikos	2002	A new approach is presented for elastic registration of medical images, and is applied to magnetic resonance images of the brain. Experimental results demonstrate remarkably high accuracy in superposition of images from different subjects, thus enabling very precise localization of morphological characteristics in population studies. There are two major novelties in the proposed algorithm. First, it uses an attribute vector, i.e. a set of geometric moment invariants that is defined on each voxel in an image, to reflect the underlying anatomy at different scales. The attribute vector, if rich enough, can distinguish between different parts of an image, which helps establishanatomical correspondences in the deformation procedure. This is a fundamental deviation of our method, referred to as HAMMER, from other volumetric deformation methods, which are typically based on maximizing image similarity. Second, in order to avoid being trapped by local minima, i.e. suboptimal poor matches, HAMMER uses a successive approximation ofthe energy function being optimized by lower dimensional energy functions, which are constructed to have significantly fewer local minima. This is achieved by hierarchically selecting features that have distinct attribute vectors, thus drastically reducing ambiguity in finding correspondence. A number of experiments in this paper have demonstrated excellent performance.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Reliable diagnoses of dementia by the naive credal classifier inferred from incomplete cognitive data.	Marco Zaffalon,Keith Wesnes,Orlando Petrini	2003	"Dementia is a serious personal, medical and social problem. Recent research indicates early and accurate diagnoses as the key to effectively cope with it. No definitive cure is available but in some cases when the impairment is still mild the disease can be contained. This paper describes a diagnostic tool that jointly uses the naive credal classifier and the most widely used computerized system of cognitive tests in dementia research, the Cognitive Drug Research system. The naive credal classifier extends the discrete naive Bayes classifier to imprecise probabilities. The naive credal classifier models both prior ignorance and ignorance about the likelihood by sets of probability distributions. This is a new way to deal with small or incomplete data sets that departs significantly from most established classification methods. In the empirical study presented here the naive credal classifier provides reliability and unmatched predictive performance. It delivers up to 95% correct predictions while being very robust with respect to the partial ignorance due to the largely incomplete data. The diagnostic tool also proves to be very effective in discriminating between Alzheimer''s disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies."

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Marginalization and health geomatics.	Gregory L. Alexander,Edward L. Kinman,Louise C. Miller,Timothy B. Patrick	2003	Marginalized groups have been defined as groups that have been peripheralized from the center of society. Increasing nursing knowledge of marginalized groups and the dynamics of population diversity will enable nurses to better recognize shifting health patterns, plan for utilization of health services, and determine ethnic and cultural differences that exist in marginalized populations. The authors of this article review theoretical models responsible for defining the concept marginalization, describe geographical information systems as a recommended tool to evaluate marginalized groups, and provide a case study utilizing tools and maps as a means of assessing marginal situations.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Mining complex clinical data for patient safety research: a framework for event discovery.	George Hripcsak,Suzanne Bakken,Peter D. Stetson,Vimla L. Patel	2003	Successfully addressing patient safety requires detecting medical events effectively. Given the volume of patients seen at medical centers, detecting events automatically from data that are already available electronically would greatly facilitate patient safety work. We have created a framework for electronic detection. Key steps include: selecting target events, assessing what information is available electronically, transforming raw data such as narrative notes into a coded format, querying the transformed data, verifying the accuracy of event detection, characterizing the events using systems and cognitive approaches, and using what is learned to improve detection.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Toward national comparable nurse practitioner data: proposed data elements, rationale, and methods.	Melinda L. Jenkins	2003	Federal funds have supported Nurse Practitioner (NP) education and the establishment of nurse-managed centers. Yet, important questions are raised about the quality and appropriate scope of NP care. Few NP-patient encounters are documented in the largest national surveys of ambulatory care, sponsored by the National Center for Health Statistics, due to sampling frames that are based on physician practices. In addition, these national surveys lack essential outcome indicators, therefore limiting their data to descriptions of patient demographics and practice patterns. Informatics principles are applied to a proposed expansion of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Its sample would include nurse-managed centers and its variables would include quality outcome and process indicators in standardized language that are nurse-sensitive and that reflect national priorities for action on health care quality. Variables for inclusion in a draft pilot instrument are identified.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A declarative implementation of the DICOM-3 network protocol.	Ira J. Kalet,Robert S. Giansiracusa,Jonathan Jacky,Drora Avitan	2003	We describe a new design for programs using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) protocol, which we have implemented in a DICOM image storage server and a radiation treatment plan transfer facility for our locally developed radiation treatment planning system, Prism. This design is declarative, representing DICOM as a language for describing messages and sequencing of messages. The coding involved implementing an interpreter for this language. The DICOM protocol specifies messages, message formats, and sequencing. In our design, the specification translates almost directly into computer-readable declarative expressions that closely resemble the relevant tabulated DICOM specifications. The resulting programs are small, simple, and extensible, because most of the details of the DICOM protocol are not coded in the procedural control statements but are in the expressions and state table that the interpreter uses to perform all its functions. This approach provides a way to validate the consistency of a specification and the correctness of the implementation. The same method can be generalized to other such protocols. It may also be used to assist the design of new protocols.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Institutional decision-making to select patient care devices: identifying venues to promote patient safety.	Alla Keselman,Vimla L. Patel,Todd R. Johnson,Jiajie Zhang	2003	Many medical errors that involve drug infusion devices are related to classic interface problems. Although manufacturers are becoming increasingly aware of human factors design considerations, many devices that are currently on the market are still sub-optimal for human use. This places significant responsibility for device selection on institutional purchasing groups. Theories of naturalistic decision-making point to many potential strengths and pitfalls of group decision-making processes that may affect the final outcome. This paper describes a retrospective analysis of decision-making process for infusion pump selection in a large hospital and focuses on factors related to patient safety. Through a series of detailed interviews and a study of relevant documentation we characterized the nature of the decision-making, patterns of communication, and the roles of different participants. Findings show that although the process involves a number of different professional groups and committees, the information flow among them is restricted. This results in inadequate representation of critical device usability considerations in the decision-making process. While all participants view device safety as an important consideration in the selection process, administrators (who are the final decision-makers) tend to equate safety with technical accuracy and reliability, paying less attention to the role of human factors in safe device use. Findings suggest that collaborative communication technology and automated evidence-based guidelines could provide support to institutional decision-making, ensuring that the process is efficient, effective, and ultimately safe for the patients.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Determining sources for formal nursing terminology systems.	Nicholas R. Hardiker	2003	Objective. The purpose of this study is to assess the relative merits of aspects labels or informal definitions--of traditional nursing terminology systems as the foundational sources for target formal nursing terminology systems.Design. This study builds upon and compares the findings of two previous experiments in which formal terminology systems, one based on informal defnitions, the other based on labels, were developed under the GALEN approach and used to generate hierarchies of nursing interventions drawn from the Nursing Interventions Classification.Measurements. The two generated hierarchies were compared to see whether, and to what extent, they captured a test set of hierarchical relationships implicit within and derived from the Nursing Interventions Classification. An analysis of the relevant conceptual representations was carried out in those cases where a hierarchical relationship from the test set was absent from either of the generated hierarchies.Results. The hierarchy generated from the formal terminology system based on informal definitions contained none of the test set of hierarchical relationships. Reasons included structural differences between conceptual representations; different levels of specificity; and deficiencies within the formal terminology system itself. The hierarchy generated from the formal terminology system based on labels contained all but one of the test set. The reason for the one absence was inconsistent usage witt in source and target.Conclusions. While it may be possible to derive formal terminology systems from informal definitions for nursing interventions, the inherent complexity within those informal definitions brings into question the utility of such systems. This study demonstrates that it may be more productive to base formal nursing terminology systems on labels, simpler sources with limited discursive content and a higher degree of consistency.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Exploring semantic groups through visual approaches.	Olivier Bodenreider,Alexa T. McCray	2003	Objectives. We investigate several visual approaches for exploring semantic groups, a grouping of semantic types from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic network. We are particularly interested in the semantic coherence of the groups, and we use the semantic relationships as important indicators of that coherence.Methods. First, we create a radial representation of the number of relationships among the groups, generating a profile for each semantic group. Second, we show that, in our partition, the relationships are organized around a limited number of pivot groups and that partitions created at random do not exhibit this property. Finally, we use correspondence analysis to visualize groupings resulting from the association between semantic types and the relationships.Results. The three approaches provide different views on the semantic groups and help detect potential inconsistencies. They make outliers immediately apparent, and, thus, serve as a tool for auditing and validating both the semantic network and the semantic groups.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Towards linking patients and clinical information: detecting UMLS concepts in e-mail.	Patricia Flatley Brennan,Alan R. Aronson	2003	"The purpose of this project is to explore the feasibility of detecting terms within the electronic messages of patients that could be used to effectively search electronic knowledge resources and bring health information resources into the hands of patients. Our team is exploring the application of the natural language processing (NLP) tools built within the Lister Hill Center at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to the challenge of detecting relevant concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) within the free text of lay people's electronic messages (e-mail). We obtained a sample of electronic messages sent by patients participating in a randomized field evaluation of an internet-based home care support service to the project nurse, and we subjected elements of these messages to a series of analyses using several vocabularies from the UMLS Metathesaurus and the selected NLP tools. The nursing vocabularies provide an excellent starting point for this exercise because their domain encompasses patient's responses to health challenges. In successive runs we augmented six nursing vocabularies (NANDA Nursing Diagnosis, Nursing Interventions Classification, Nursing Outcomes Classification, Home Health Classification, Omaha System, and the Patient Care Data Set) with selected sets of clinical terminologies (International Classification of Primary Care; International Classification of Primary Care- American English; Micromedex DRUGDEX; National Drug Data File; Thesaurus of Psychological Terms; WHO Adverse Drug Reaction Terminology) and then additionally with either Medical Subject Heading (MESH) or SNOMED International terms. The best performance was obtained when the nursing vocabularies were complemented with selected clinical terminologies. These findings have implications not only for facilitating lay people's access to electronic knowledge resources but may also be of assistance in developing new tools to aid in linking free text (e.g., clinical notes) to lexically complex knowledge resources such as those emerging from the Human Genome Project."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A term extraction tool for expanding content in the domain of functioning, disability, and health: proof of concept.	Marcelline R. Harris,Guergana K. Savova,Thomas M. Johnson,Christopher G. Chute	2003	Among the challenges in developing terminology systems is providing complete content coverage of specialized subject fields. This paper reports on a term extraction tool designed for the development and expansion of terminology systems concerned with functioning, disability, and health. Content relevant to this domain is the emphasis of the foci and targets of many nursing terminologies. We extend previously published term extraction algorithms by applying two filters. The first filter is based on the raw frequency of the content words in the lexical string under consideration. The second filter applies the notion of a complete syntactic node to discover relevant noun or verb phrases. While we report on a limited corpus (30,607 words comprising 4103 terms from 60 dismissal note summaries), the recall, precision, and F-measures we observed are encouraging and suggest continued development and testing of the tool is merited.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Assessing explicit error reporting in the narrative electronic medical record using keyword searching.	Hui Cao,Peter D. Stetson,George Hripcsak	2003	"Background. Many types of medical errors occur in and outside of hospitals, some of which have very serious consequences and increase cost. Identifying errors is a critical step for managing and preventing them. In this study, we assessed the explicit reporting of medical errors in the electronic record.Method. We used five search terms ""mistake,"" ""error,"" ""incorrect,"" ""inadvertent,"" and ""iatrogenic"" to survey several sets of narrative reports including discharge summaries, signout notes, and outpatient notes from 1991 to 2000. We manually reviewed all the positive cases and identified them based on the reporting of physicians.Result. We identified 222 explicitly reported medical errors. The positive predictive value varied with different keywords. In general, the positive predictive value for each keyword was low, ranging from 3.4 to 24.4%. Therapeutic-related errors were the most common reported errors and these reported therapeutic-related errors were mainly medication errors.Conclusion. Keyword searches combined with manual review indicated some medical errors that were reported in medical records. It had a low sensitivity and a moderate positive predictive value, which varied by search term. Physicians were most likely to record errors in the Hospital Course and History of Present Illness sections of discharge summaries. The reported errors in medical records covered a broad range and were related to several types of care providers as well as non-health care professionals."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Grounding a new information technology implementation framework in behavioral science: a systematic analysis of the literature on IT use.	Rita Kukafka,Stephen B. Johnson,Allison Linfante,John P. Allegrante	2003	Many interventions to improve the success of information technology (IT) implementations are grounded in behavioral science, using theories, and models to identify conditions and determinants of successful use. However, each model in the IT literature has evolved to address specific theoretical problems of particular disciplinary concerns, and each model has been tested and has evolved using, in most cases, a more or less restricted set of IT implementation procedures. Functionally, this limits the perspective for taking into account the multiple factors at the individual, group, and organizational levels that influence use behavior. While a rich body of literature has emerged, employing prominent models such as the Technology Adoption Model, Social-Cognitive Theory, and Diffusion of Innovation Theory, the complexity of defining a suitable multi-level intervention has largely been overlooked. A gap exists between the implementation of IT and the integration of theories and models that can be utilized to develop multi-level approaches to identify factors that impede usage behavior. We present a novel framework that is intended to guide synthesis of more than one theoretical perspective for the purpose of planning multi-level interventions to enhance IT use. This integrative framework is adapted from PRECEDE/PROCEDE, a conceptual framework used by health planners in hundreds of published studies to direct interventions that account for the multiple determinants of behavior. Since we claim that the literature on IT use behavior does not now include a multi-level approach, we undertook a systematic literature analysis to confirm this assertion. Our framework facilitated organizing this literature synthesis and our analysis was aimed at determining if the IT implementation approaches in the published literature were characterized by an approach that considered at least two levels of IT usage determinants. We found that while 61% of studies mentioned or referred to theory, none considered two or more levels. In other words, although the researchers employ behavioral theory, they omit two fundamental propositions: (1) IT usage is influenced by multiple factors and (2) interventions must be multi-dimensional. Our literature synthesis may provide additional insight into the reason for high failure rates associated with underutilized systems, and underscores the need to move beyond the current dominant approach that employs a single model to guide IT implementation plans that aim to address factors associated with IT acceptance and subsequent positive use behavior.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Effective drug-allergy checking: methodological and operational issues.	Gilad J. Kuperman,Tejal K. Gandhi,David W. Bates	2003	Adverse drug events cause a large number of injuries, and adverse events caused by medications administered in the face of known allergies represent an important preventable cause of patient harm. Computerized systems can effectively prevent reactions due to known allergies, but building an effective allergy prevention feature is challenging and presents many interesting informatics issues that have both methodological and operational implications. In this paper, we present the experiences from one large delivery system in delivering allergy-related decision support, discuss some of the different approaches that we have used, and then propose a future approach. We also discuss the methodological, behavioral, and operational issues that have arisen which have a major impact on success. Key factors in drug-allergy checking include storing patient allergy data in a single common repository, representing allergy data using suitable terminologies and creating groups of allergies for inferencing purposes, being judicious about which allergy warnings to display, conveying the reaction that the patient has experienced when exposed to the drug to inform the provider of the importance of the warning, and perhaps most important, implementing strategies to optimize the likelihood that allergy information will be entered.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Medical errors as a result of specialization.	Ahmad Hashem,Michelene T. H. Chi,Charles P. Friedman	2003	"Errors in medicine result in over 44,000 preventable deaths annually. Some of these errors are made by specialized physicians at the time of diagnosis. Building on error frameworks proposed in the literature, we tested the experimental hypothesis that physicians within a given specialty have a bias in diagnosing cases outside their own domain as being within that domain. Thirty-two board-certified physicians from four internal medicine subspecialties worked four patient cases each. Verbal protocol analysis and general linear modeling of the numerical data seem to confirm the experimental hypothesis, indicating that specialists try to ""pull"" cases toward their specialty. Specialists generate more diagnostic hypotheses within their domain than outside, and assign higher probabilities to diagnoses within that domain."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Bayesian networks for knowledge discovery in large datasets: basics for nurse researchers.	Sun-Mi Lee,Patricia A. Abbott	2003	The growth of nursing databases necessitates new approaches to data analyses. These databases, which are known to be massive and multidimensional, easily exceed the capabilities of both human cognition and traditional analytical approaches. One innovative approach, knowledge discovery in large databases (KDD), allows investigators to analyze very large data sets more comprehensively in an automatic or a semi-automatic manner. Among KDD techniques, Bayesian networks, a state-of-the art representation of probabilistic knowledge by a graphical diagram, has emerged in recent years as essential for pattern recognition and classification in the healthcare field. Unlike some data mining techniques, Bayesian networks allow investigators to combine domain knowledge with statistical data, enabling nurse researchers to incorporate clinical and theoretical knowledge into the process of knowledge discovery in large datasets. This tailored discussion presents the basic concepts of Bayesian networks and their use as knowledge discovery tools for nurse researchers.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Development and evaluation of a terminology-based electronic nursing record system.	InSook Cho,Hyeoun-Ae Park	2003	The present study was conducted to develop and evaluate a terminology-based electronic nursing record system. The narrative nursing notes of 63 obstetric patients collected over 395 hospital days were decomposed and cross-mapped with the Korean version of the beta version of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP). The terminology-based nursing record system was developed with a terminology server to manage nursing concepts and nursing phrases, and a user application system to document nursing notes. The system was evaluated in two Korean hospitals by 20 nurses documenting nursing notes of 57 patients. Patterns were found in nursing notes reflecting the nursing process. A total of 14,727 phrases were used for documenting nursing notes, with these phrases consisting of 237 unique phrases. Among the 259 unique nursing concepts extracted from the 237 unique phrases, 103 concepts (39.8%) did not map onto the ICNP. The users were able to find nursing phrases with a success rate of 89.4%. The mean time required for documentation at each input session decreased significantly from 276 to 158 s as the users became more experienced.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Consistency across the hierarchies of the UMLS Semantic Network and Metathesaurus.	James J. Cimino,Hua Min,Yehoshua Perl	2003	"Objective. To develop and test a method for automatically detecting inconsistencies between the parent-child is-a relationships in the Metathesaurus and the ancestor-descendant relationships in the Semantic Network of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).Methods. We exploited the fact that each Metathesaurus concept is assigned one or more semantic types from the UMLS Semantic Network and that the semantic types are arranged in a hierarchy. We compared the semantic types of each pair of parent and child concepts to determine if the types ""explained"" the Metathesaurus is-a relationships. We considered cases where the semantic type of the parent was neither the same as, nor an ancestor of, the semantic type of the child to be ""unexplained."" We applied this method to the January 2002 release of the UMLS and examined the unexplained cases we discovered to determine their causes.Results. We found that 17,022 (24.3%) of the parent--child is-a relationships in the UMLS Metathesaurus could not be explained based on the semantic types of the concepts. Causes for these discrepancies included cases where the parent or child was missing a semantic type, cases where the semantic type of the child was too general or the semantic type of the parent was too specific, cases where the parent-child relationship was incorrect, and cases where an ancestor-descendant relationship should be added to the UMLS Semantic network. In many cases, the specific cause of the discrepancy cannot be resolved without authoritative judgment by the UMLS developers.Conclusions. Our method successfully detects inconsistencies between the hierarchies of the UMLS Metathesaurus and Semantic Network. We believe that our method should be added to the set of tools that the UMLS developers use to maintain and audit the UMLS knowledge sources."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A shallow parser based on closed-class words to capture relations in biomedical text.	Gondy Leroy,Hsinchun Chen,Jesse D. Martinez	2003	Natural language processing for biomedical text currently focuses mostly on entity and relation extraction. These entities and relations are usually pre-specified entities, e.g., proteins, and pre-specified relations, e.g., inhibit relations. A shallow parser that captures the relations between noun phrases automatically from free text has been developed and evaluated. It uses heuristics and a noun phraser to capture entities of interest in the text. Cascaded finite state automata structure the relations between individual entities. The automata are based on closed-class English words and model generic relations not limited to specific words. The parser also recognizes coordinating conjunctions and captures negation in text, a feature usually ignored by others. Three cancer researchers evaluated 330 relations extracted from 26 abstracts of interest to them. There were 296 relations correctly extracted from the abstracts resulting in 90% precision of the relations and an average of 11 correct relations per abstract.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Modeling nursing interventions in the act class of HL7 RIM Version 3.	Amy Danko,Rosemary Kennedy,Robert Haskell,Ida M. Androwich,Patricia Button,Carol M. Correia,Susan J. Grobe,Marcelline R. Harris,Susan Matney,Daniel C. Russler	2003	The proposed Health Level 7 Reference Information Model (HL7 RIM) Version 3 is the foundation for expressing data to be communicated across health care information systems. The general objective of this analysis was to examine whether the RIM supports the expression of nursing interventions, considering both terminological and structural perspectives. The Nursing Terminology Summit Interventions Group focused on patient education about breast cancer, an intervention that differs sufficiently from other medical processes already considered by HL7 and represents issues surrounding both definition and execution of nursing process. Relevant actors, actions, and action relationships were culled from use cases and modeled into the proposed RIM structure and attributes by using modified instance diagrams. This method was effective and reproducible, and the RIM proved to be an adequate model for supporting breast cancer education. Additional interventions must be studied to fully assess the adequacy of the model to support all aspects of nursing process and terminology.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A framework for analyzing the cognitive complexity of computer-assisted clinical ordering.	Jan Horsky,David R. Kaufman,Michael I. Oppenheim,Vimla L. Patel	2003	"Computer-assisted provider order entry is a technology that is designed to expedite medical ordering and to reduce the frequency of preventable errors. This paper presents a multifaceted cognitive methodology for the characterization of cognitive demands of a medical information system. Our investigation was informed by the distributed resources (DR) model, a novel approach designed to describe the dimensions of user interfaces that introduce unnecessary cognitive complexity. This method evaluates the relative distribution of external (system) and internal (user) representations embodied in system interaction. We conducted an expert walkthrough evaluation of a commercial order entry system, followed by a simulated clinical ordering task performed by seven clinicians. The DR model was employed to explain variation in user performance and to characterize the relationship of resource distribution and ordering errors. The analysis revealed that the configuration of resources in this ordering application placed unnecessarily heavy cognitive demands on the user, especially on those who lacked a robust conceptual model of the system. The resources model also provided some insight into clinicians' interactive strategies and patterns of associated errors. Implications for user training and interface design based on the principles of human-computer interaction in the medical domain are discussed."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Adequacy of evolving national standardized terminologies for interdisciplinary coded concepts in an automated clinical pathway.	Patricia C. Dykes,Leanne M. Currie,James J. Cimino	2003	Purpose. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the adequacy of evolving national standardized terminologies with regard to coded data elements (concepts) in an automated clinical pathway designed to drive adherence with the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Evaluation and Management of Chronic Heart Failure.Method. Concepts were identified in a previously developed automated clinical pathway and associated tools. Once identified, concepts were categorized according to the conceptual domains identified by Campbell et al. (1997). A review of evolving national standardized terminologies and coding systems was initiated to determine if the identified concepts had corresponding representation in one of these coding systems. Available codes were then evaluated for adequacy with respect to national guideline adherence measures put forth by the Centers for Medicare/Medicaid Services (CMS) and Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).Results. The concept domain model put forth by Campbell et al. (1997) worked well for organizing concepts and for providing a useful framework for data analysis. Using our method, 260 unique pathway concepts were identified, of which, 91.9% (239) are represented by one or more of the standardized coding systems. Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) and SNOMED CT alone represented 86.2% of the concepts. Seventy percent (70%) of the clinical pathway concepts are represented using the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandated national terminologies alone. Less than 50% of CMS and JCAHO guideline adherence concepts were found to have representation in the HIPAA mandated terminologies. The addition of Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes (LOINC) and SNOMED CT improved representation up to 86.4%, but did not include representation of all concepts necessary for complete electronic monitoring of guideline adherence.Conclusions. Evolving national standardized terminologies provided matching terms for the majority of the data elements in the automated clinical pathway. Standard clinical terminologies with granular terms such as LOINC and SNOMED CT are required to represent the depth and detail of certain procedures and guideline-based care. Gaps exist in Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandated terminologies for representing interdisciplinary concepts in national adherence measures.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Using computational modeling to transform nursing data into actionable information.	Judith A. Effken,Barbara B. Brewer,Anita Patil,Gerri S. Lamb,Joyce A. Verran,Kathleen M. Carley	2003	Transforming organizational research data into actionable information nurses can use to improve patient outcomes remains a challenge. Available data are numerous, at multiple levels of analysis, and snapshots in time, which makes application difficult in a dynamically changing healthcare system. One potential solution is computational modeling. We describe our use of OrgAhead, a theoretically based computational modeling program developed at Carnegie Mellon University, to transform data into actionable nursing information. We calibrated the model by using data from 16 actual patient care units to adjust model parameters until performance of simulated units ordered in the same way as observed performance of the actual units 80% of the time. In future research, we will use OrgAhead to generate hypotheses about changes nurses might make to improve patient outcomes, help nurses use these hypotheses to identify and implement changes on their units, and then measure the impact of those changes on patient outcomes.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Representing nursing assessments in clinical information systems using the logical observation identifiers, names, and codes database.	Susan Matney,Suzanne Bakken,Stanley M. Huff	2003	"In recent years, the Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC) Database has been expanded to include assessment items of relevance to nursing and in 2002 met the criteria for ""recognition"" by the American Nurses Association. Assessment measures in LOINC include those related to vital signs, obstetric measurements, clinical assessment scales, assessments from standardized nursing terminologies, and research instruments. In order for LOINC to be of greater use in implementing information systems that support nursing practice, additional content is needed. Moreover, those implementing systems for nursing practice must be aware of the manner in which LOINC codes for assessments can be appropriately linked with other aspects of the nursing process such as diagnoses and interventions. Such linkages are necessary to document nursing contributions to healthcare outcomes within the context of a multidisciplinary care environment and to facilitate building of nursing knowledge from clinical practice. The purposes of this paper are to provide an overview of the LOINC database, to describe examples of assessments of relevance to nursing contained in LOINC, and to illustrate linkages of LOINC assessments with other nursing concepts."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Role and experience determine decision support interface requirements in a neonatal intensive care environment.	Gary Ewing,Yvonne Freer,Robert Logie,Jim Hunter,Neil McIntosh,Sue Rudkin,Lindsey Ferguson	2003	"The aim of this paper is to describe a novel approach to the analysis of data obtained from card-sorting experiments. These experiments were performed as a part of the initial phase of a project, called NEONATE. One of the aims of the project is to develop decision support tools for the neonatal intensive care environment. Physical card-sorts were performed using clinical ""action"" and patient ""descriptor"" words. Thirty-two staff (eight junior nurses, eight senior nurses, eight junior doctors, and eight senior doctors) participated in the actions card-sorts and the same number of staff participated in separate descriptors card-sorting experiments. To check for consistency, the card-sorts were replicated for nurses during the action card-sorts. The card-sort data were analysed using hierarchical cluster analysis to produce tree-diagrams or dendrograms. Differences were shown in the way various classes of staff with different levels of experience mentally map clinical concepts. Clinical actions were grouped more loosely by nurses and by those with less experience, with a polarisation between senior doctors and junior nurses. Descriptors were classed more definitively and similarly by nurses and senior doctors but in a less structured way and quite differently by junior doctors. This paper presents a summary of the differences in the card-sort data for the various staff categories. It is shown that concepts are used differently by various staff groups in a neonatal unit and that this may diminish the effectiveness of computerised decision aids unless it is explored during their development."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A vocabulary development and visualization tool based on natural language processing and the mining of textual patient reports.	Carol Friedman,Hongfang Liu,Lyudmila Shagina	2003	Medical terminologies are critical for automated healthcare systems. Some terminologies, such as the UMLS and SNOMED are comprehensive, whereas others specialize in limited domains (i.e., BIRADS) or are developed for specific applications. An important feature of a terminology is comprehensive coverage of relevant clinical terms and ease of use by users, which include computerized applications. We have developed a method for facilitating vocabulary development and maintenance that is based on utilization of natural language processing to mine large collections of clinical reports in order to obtain information on terminology as expressed by physicians. Once the reports are processed and the terms structured and collected into an XML representational schema, it is possible to determine information about terms, such as frequency of occurrence, compositionality, relations to other terms (such as modifiers), and correspondence to a controlled vocabulary. This paper describes the method and discusses how it can be used as a tool to help vocabulary builders navigate through the terms physicians use, visualize their relations to other terms via a flexible viewer, and determine their correspondence to a controlled vocabulary.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A tiered approach is more cost effective than traditional pharmacist-based review for classifying computer-detected signals as adverse drug events.	Carol Hope,J. Marc Overhage,Andrew Seger,Evgenia Teal,Vera Mills,Julie Fiskio,Tejal K. Gandhi,David W. Bates,Michael D. Murray	2003	"Objective. To develop a cost-efficient method for identifying adverse drug events (ADEs) and medication errors (MEs) identified using outpatient electronic medical records within ambulatory settings.Design. Comparison of sensitivity and cost of ""traditional"" pharmacist based approach to identifying ADEs and MEs during a 4 month period with a tiered approach.Results. The proportion of computer generated signals analyzed identified as ADEs were similar using the two approaches while the number of MEs was nearly double with tiered reviews suggesting the same or better sensitivity. Traditional pharmacist review cost $68.70 to detect an ADE and tiered approach cost only $42.40.Conclusion. Tiered review of ADEs and MEs by personnel with increasing clinical capability is more cost-efficient than pharmacist review."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Data mining issues and opportunities for building nursing knowledge.	Linda Goodwin,Michele VanDyne,Simon Lin,Steven Talbert	2003	"Health care information systems tend to capture data for nursing tasks, and have little basis in nursing knowledge. Opportunity lies in an important issue where the knowledge used by expert nurses (nursing knowledge workers) in caring for patients is undervalued in the health care system. The complexity of nursing's knowledge base remains poorly articulated and inadequately represented in contemporary information systems. There is opportunity for data mining methods to assist with discovering important linkages between clinical data, nursing interventions, and patient outcomes. Following a brief overview of relevant data mining techniques, a preterm risk prediction case study illustrates the opportunities and describes typical data mining issues in the nontrivial task of building knowledge. Building knowledge in nursing, using data mining or any other method, will make progress only if important data that capture expert nurses' contributions are available in clinical information systems configurations."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Retrospective data collection and analytical techniques for patient safety studies.	Matthew B. Weinger,Jason Slagle,Sonia Jain,Nelda Ordonez	2003	To enhance patient safety, data about actual clinical events must be collected and scrutinized. This paper has two purposes. First, it provides an overview of some of the methods available to collect and analyze retrospective data about medical errors, near misses, and other relevant patient safety events. Second, it introduces a methodological approach that focuses on non-routine events (NRE), defined as all events that deviate from optimal clinical care. In intermittent in-person surveys of anesthesia providers, 75 of 277 (27%) recently completed anesthetic cases contained a non-routine event (98 total NRE). Forty-six of the cases (17%) had patient impact while only 20 (7%) led to patient injury. In contrast, in the same hospitals over a two-year period, we collected event data on 135 cases identified with traditional quality improvement processes (event incidence of 0.7-2.7%). In these quality improvement cases, 120 (89%) had patient impact and 74 (55%) led to patient injury. Preliminary analyses not only illustrate some of the analytical methods applicable to safety data but also provide insight into the potential value of the non-routine event approach for the early detection of risks to patient safety before serious patient harm occurs.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A nursing perspective to design and implementation of electronic patient record systems.	Anne Moen	2003	"Achievements in informatics and use of new technologies are important to develop knowledge from clinical nursing practice. At the same time, progress in design and implementation of clinical information systems such as comprehensive Electronic Patient Record (EPR) systems can be complemented by attention to and examination of information processes as well as the health care constituencies' characteristics. In this article, selected issues and challenges related to EPR design and implementation are reviewed with a particular emphasis on those related to nursing practice and nursing leadership."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	OQAFMA Querying Agent for the Foundational Model of Anatomy: a prototype for providing flexible and efficient access to large semantic networks.	Peter Mork,James F. Brinkley,Cornelius Rosse	2003	The development of large semantic networks, such as the UMLS, which are intended to support a variety of applications, requires a flexible and efficient query interface for the extraction of information. Using one of the source vocabularies of UMLS as a test bed, we have developed such a prototype query interface. We first identify common classes of queries needed by applications that access these semantic networks. Next, we survey STRUQL, an existing query language that we adopted, which supports all of these classes of queries. We then describe the OQAFMA Querying Agent for the Foundational Model of Anatomy (OQAFMA), which provides an efficient implementation of a subset of STRUQL by pre-computing a variety of indices. We describe how OQAFMA leverages database optimization by converting STRUQL queries to SQL. We evaluate the flexibility and efficiency of our implementation using English queries written by anatomists. This evaluation verifies that OQAFMA provides flexible, efficient access to one such large semantic network, the Foundational Model of Anatomy, and suggests that OQAFMA could be an efficient query interface to other large biomedical knowledge bases, such as the Unified Medical Language System.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Evaluation of the draft international standard for a reference terminology model for nursing actions.	Jacqueline Moss,Amy Coenen,Mary Etta Mills	2003	"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the draft ISO reference terminology model (RTM) for nursing actions. Nursing RTM models attempt to include concepts that are universally represented in nursing documentation to improve the depiction of nursing practice in computerized systems.Method: Content analysis was used to decompose interventions into words and phrases, which were then mapped to the six model categories used to represent nursing actions in the draft ISO RTM. The decomposition of interventions was applied to nurses' documentation of pain interventions entered into a clinical information system.Findings: Consistent with the ISO standard requirements, all (100.00%) of the interventions contained an 〈action〉1 word or phrase and a «target». Additional findings are discussed in relation to earlier studies of terminology models.Conclusions: It is recommended that terminology and information system developers consider this model in their ongoing system development, evaluation, maintenance, and revisions. Further evaluation of the ISO RTM for nursing will contribute to the goals of this specific model and the harmonization and integration with other health care models."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Detecting adverse events for patient safety research: a review of current methodologies.	Harvey J. Murff,Vimla L. Patel,George Hripcsak,David W. Bates	2003	"Promoting patient safety is a national priority. To evaluate interventions for reducing medical errors and adverse event, effective methods for detecting such events are required. This paper reviews the current methodologies for detection of adverse events and discusses their relative advantages and limitations. It also presents a cognitive framework for error monitoring and detection. While manual chart review has been considered the ""gold-standard"" for identifying adverse events in many patient safety studies, this methodology is expensive and imperfect. Investigators have developed or are currently evaluating, several electronic methods that can detect adverse events using coded data, free-text clinical narratives, or a combination of techniques. Advances in these systems will greatly facilitate our ability to monitor adverse events and promote patient safety research. But these systems will perform optimally only if we improve our understanding of the fundamental nature of errors and the ways in which the human mind can naturally, but erroneously, contribute to the problems that we observe."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Experimental analysis of heart rate variability of long-recording electrocardiograms in normal subjects and patients with coronary artery disease and normal left ventricular function.	Stavros Nikolopoulos,Anastasia Alexandridi,S. Nikolakeas,George Manis	2003	The heart rate signal contains valuable information about cardiac health, which cannot be extracted without the use of appropriate computerized methods. This paper presents an analysis of various electrocardiograms, the aim of which is to categorize them into two distinct groups. Group A represents young male subjects with no prior occurrence of coronary disease events and Group B represents middle-aged male subjects who have symptomatic coronary artery disease without myocardial infarction and whose 12-lead ECGs do not contain any abnormalities, thus wrongly indicating a normal subject. Electrocardiographic recordings are approximately 2 h in length and acquired under conditions that favor the stationarity of collected data. Linear and nonlinear characteristics are studied by applying several techniques including Fourier analysis, Correlation Dimension Estimation, Approximate Entropy, and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. The small variations of the diagnostic information given by each one of the methods as well as the slightly different conclusions among similar studies indicate the necessity of further investigation, combined use, and complementary application of different approaches.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The Nursing Terminology Summit Conferences: a case study of successful collaboration for change.	Judy Ozbolt	2003	The Nursing Terminology Summit, a series of invitational conferences and ongoing collaboration, has played both initiating and contributing roles to bring about a second-order change in the development and integration of standards for nursing terminology. What factors enabled this success? What factors made change difficult? This paper examines the structure and process of the Nursing Terminology Summit using concepts, principles, theories, and strategies identified in Lorenzi and Riley [Organizational Aspects of Health Informatics: Managing Technological Change, Springer, 1995]. As a case study, this critical analysis offers practical lessons for informaticians in managing change across disciplinary, organizational, and national boundaries.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Methods in informatics: using data derived from a systematic review of health care texts to develop a concept map for use in the neonatal intensive care setting.	Teresa L. Panniers,Renee Daiuta Feuerbach,Karen L. Soeken	2003	"A qualitative systematic review of textbooks and clinical guidelines identified assessment criteria for initiation of nipple feeds in premature infants cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting. Using a structured method for text source selection and data extraction, 43 health care texts were systematically reviewed yielding 153 separate statements related to assessing premature infants' feeding readiness. Following this procedure, a pile sort method was conducted wherein an expert neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) grouped the statements according to similarity in meaning. Ten piles of terms emerged from this process. Each pile was ""named,"" depicting discrete components used when assessing premature infants' readiness for nipple feeding. Using these public data and the private knowledge of the NNP informant, a concept map was constructed to illustrate a framework for decision support development and to examine the map's usefulness for structuring knowledge that will provide input to an intelligent decision support system."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Using usability heuristics to evaluate patient safety of medical devices.	Jiajie Zhang,Todd R. Johnson,Vimla L. Patel,Danielle L. Paige,Tate K. Kubose	2003	Objective. To modify the traditional heuristic evaluation method of assessing software usability so that it can be applied to medical devices and used to evaluate the patient safety of those devices through the identification and assessment of usability problems.Design. Heuristic evaluation, a usability inspection method commonly used for software usability evaluation, was modified and extended for medical devices. The modified method was used to evaluate and compare the patient safety of two 1-channel volumetric infusion pumps.Results. The modified heuristic evaluation method was successfully applied to medical devices. One hundred and ninety-two heuristic violations were categorized for 89 usability problems identified for Pump 1, and 121 heuristic violations were categorized for the 52 usability problems identified for Pump 2. Pump 1 had more usability problems with high severity ratings than Pump 2. In general, Pump 1 was found to have more usability issues that are likely to induce more medical errors.Conclusions. Heuristic evaluation, when modified for medical devices, is a useful, efficient, and low cost method for evaluating patient safety features of medical devices through the identification of usability problems and their severities.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Designing metaschemas for the UMLS enriched semantic network.	Li Zhang,Yehoshua Perl,Michael Halper,James Geller	2003	"The enriched semantic network (ESN) has previously been presented as an enhancement of the semantic network (SN) of the UMLS. The ESN's hierarchy is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure allowing for multiple parents. The ESN is thus more complex than the SN and can be more difficult to view and comprehend. We have previously introduced the notion of a metaschema for the SN as a compact abstraction to support SN comprehension. We extend the definition of metaschema to make it applicable to a DAG classification hierarchy, such as the one exhibited by the ESN. We specify the requirements for and describe the general process of deriving such a metaschema. We derive two particular metaschemas of the ESN based on a pair of partitious. These two metaschemas and their underlying partitions are compared. Both metaschemas serve as compact representations of the ESN, allowing for convenient viewing of its hierarchy and easier comprehension."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Controlled vocabularies for consumer health.	Rita D. Zielstorff	2003	There is often a disconnect between the language that consumers use to express health concerns and the language that is used by health care professionals. At the same time, health care consumerism and the availability of vast health-related resources on the Internet have resulted in millions of persons using the Internet for health-related matters daily. The mismatch in language, however, poses a barrier to access to relevant information. It also prevents full participation in shared health records, and sometimes interferes in communication between patients and their health care providers. Nurse informaticians, with their deep expertise in vocabulary development, could play an important role in solving this dilemma. Structured vocabularies comprised of lay terms, with definitions, variant spellings, and regional dialects, along with mappings to equivalent or related professional terms, could make health literature much more accessible to consumers, and provide the basis for bi-directional translation of health terms in a shared medical record. In addition, the presence of terms for which no representation currently exists in nursing terminologies could serve as a stimulus for developing new knowledge about patient phenomena not previously recognized.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Design and implementation of a comprehensive outpatient Results Manager.	Eric G. Poon,Samuel J. Wang,Tejal K. Gandhi,David W. Bates,Gilad J. Kuperman	2003	Prior research has demonstrated that clinicians often fail to review and act upon outpatient test results in a timely and appropriate manner. To address this patient safety and quality of care issue, Partners Healthcare has developed a browser-based, provider-centric, comprehensive results management application to help clinic physicians review and act upon test results in a safe, reliable, and efficient manner. The application, called the Results Manager, incorporates extensive decision support features to classify the degree of abnormality for each result, presents guidelines to help clinicians manage abnormal results, allows clinicians to generate result letters to patients with predefined, context-sensitive templates and prompts physicians to set reminders for future testing. In this paper, we outline the design process and functionality of Results Manager. We also discuss its underlying architectural design, which revolves around a clinical event monitor and a rules engine, and the methodological challenges encountered in designing this application.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	"Using nurses' natural language entries to build a concept-oriented terminology for patients' chief complaints in the emergency department."	Debbie A. Travers,Stephanie W. Haas	2003	"Information about the chief complaint (CC), also known as the patient's reason for seeking emergency care, is critical for patient prioritization for treatment and determination of patient flow through the emergency department (ED). Triage nurses document the CC at the start of the ED visit, and the data are increasingly available in electronic form. Despite the clinical and operational significance of the CC to the ED, there is no standard CC terminology. We propose the construction of concept-oriented nursing terminologies from the actual language used by experts. We use text analysis to extract CC concepts from triage nurses' natural language entries. Our methodology for building the nursing terminology utilizes natural language processing techniques and the Unified Medical Language System."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The interaction of domain knowledge and linguistic structure in natural language processing: interpreting hypernymic propositions in biomedical text.	Thomas C. Rindflesch,Marcelo Fiszman	2003	Interpretation of semantic propositions in free-text documents such as MEDLINE citations would provide valuable support for biomedical applications, and several approaches to semantic interpretation are being pursued in the biomedical informatics community. In this paper, we describe a methodology for interpreting linguistic structures that encode hypernymic propositions, in which a more specific concept is in a taxonomic relationship with a more general concept. In order to effectively process these constructions, we exploit underspecified syntactic analysis and structured domain knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). After introducing the syntactic processing on which our system depends, we focus on the UMLS knowledge that supports interpretation of hypernymic propositions. We first use semantic groups from the Semantic Network to ensure that the two concepts involved are compatible; hierarchical information in the Metathesaurus then determines which concept is more general and which more specific. A preliminary evaluation of a sample based on the semantic group Chemicals and Drugs provides 83% precision. An error analysis was conducted and potential solutions to the problems encountered are presented. The research discussed here serves as a paradigm for investigating the interaction between domain knowledge and linguistic structure in natural language processing, and could also make a contribution to research on automatic processing of discourse structure. Additional implications of the system we present include its integration in advanced semantic interpretation processors for biomedical text and its use for information extraction in specific domains. The approach has the potential to support a range of applications, including information retrieval and ontology engineering.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A reference ontology for biomedical informatics: the Foundational Model of Anatomy.	Cornelius Rosse,José L. V. Mejino Jr.	2003	The Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), initially developed as an enhancement of the anatomical content of UMLS, is a domain ontology of the concepts and relationships that pertain to the structural organization of the human body. It encompasses the material objects from the molecular to the macroscopic levels that constitute the body and associates with them nonmaterial entities (spaces, surfaces, lines, and points) required for describing structural relationships. The disciplined modeling approach employed for the development of the FMA relies on a set of declared principles, high level schemes, Aristotelian definitions and a frame-based authoring environment. We propose the FMA as a reference ontology in biomedical informatics for correlating different views of anatomy, aligning existing and emerging ontologies in bioinformatics ontologies and providing a structure-based template for representing biological functions.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Representative threats for research in public health surveillance.	Michael M. Wagner,Virginia Dato,John N. Dowling,Michael Allswede	2003	"A large number of biological agents can cause natural or bioterroristic disease outbreaks and each can present in a bewildering number of ways (e.g., a few cases versus many cases, confined to a building versus widely disseminated). This 'problem space' is a challenge for designers of early warning systems for disease outbreaks and the sheer size of this space is a barrier to progress.This paper addresses this problem by deriving nine categories of threats that represent a parsimonious characterization of the problem space. A literature search also identified one or more example outbreaks for each of the nine categories. These outbreaks have occurred in recent times and could be used by researchers in need of actual outbreak data for investigations of the role of different types of surveillance data and algorithms in outbreak detection.The methodological contribution of this research is a Criterion Set of threats for analysis and evaluation of detection systems. This set characterizes the problem space in a tractable manner with less loss of generality than analyses based on one or two selected diseases, which is representative of current analyses."

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Evaluation of glucose controllers in virtual environment: methodology and sample application.	Ludovic J. Chassin,Malgorzata E. Wilinska,Roman Hovorka	2004	Objective: Adaptive systems to deliver medical treatment in humans are safety-critical systems and require particular care in both the testing and the evaluation phase, which are time-consuming, costly, and confounded by ethical issues. The objective of the present work is to develop a methodology to test glucose controllers of an artificial pancreas in a simulated (virtual) environment.Material and methods: A virtual environment comprising a model of the carbohydrate metabolism and models of the insulin pump and the glucose sensor is employed to simulate individual glucose excursions in subjects with type 1 diabetes. The performance of the control algorithm within the virtual environment is evaluated by considering treatment and operational scenarios.Results: The developed methodology includes two dimensions: testing in relation to specific life style conditions, i.e. fasting, post-prandial, and life style (metabolic) disturbances; and testing in relation to various operating conditions, i.e. expected operating conditions, adverse operating conditions, and system failure. We define safety and efficacy criteria and describe the measures to be taken prior to clinical testing. The use of the methodology is exemplified by tuning and evaluating a model predictive glucose controller being developed for a wearable artificial pancreas focused on fasting conditions.Conclusion: Our methodology to test glucose controllers in a virtual environment is instrumental in anticipating the results of real clinical tests for different physiological conditions and for different operating conditions. The thorough testing in the virtual environment reduces costs and speeds up the development process.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Prediction of visual perceptions with artificial neural networks in a visual prosthesis for the blind.	Cédric Archambeau,Jean Delbeke,Claude Veraart,Michel Verleysen	2004	Within the framework of the OPTIVIP project, an optic nerve based visual prosthesis is developed in order to restore partial vision to the blind. One of the main challenges is to understand, decode and model the physiological process linking the stimulating parameters to the visual sensations produced in the visual field of a blind volunteer. We propose to use adaptive neural techniques. Two prediction models are investigated. The first one is a grey-box model exploiting the neurophysiological knowledge available up to now. It combines a neurophysiological model with artificial neural networks, such as multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis function networks, in order to predict the features of the visual perceptions. The second model is entirely of the black-box type. We show that both models provide satisfactory prediction tools and achieve similar prediction accuracies. Moreover, we demonstrate that significant improvement (25%) was gained with respect to linear statistical methods, suggesting that the biological process is strongly non-linear.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Adaptive ventilator FiO2 advisor: use of non-invasive estimations of shunt.	H.-F. Kwok,Derek A. Linkens,Mahdi Mahfouf,Gary H. Mills	2004	A non-invasive and simple method of parameter estimation has been developed for the model-based decision support of the artificial ventilation in intensive care units. The parameter concerned was the respiratory shunt. Originally, the shunt had to be estimated using a numerical algorithm, which was slow and unreliable. The estimation process also required the knowledge of other parameters, whose values could only be obtained using invasive monitoring equipment. In this paper, the respiratory index is used for the shunt estimation. A linear regression model and a non-linear adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model were used to describe the relationship between the respiratory index and the shunt. The shunts estimated using these models were then used to calculate the fractional inspired oxygen needed to attain the target arterial oxygen level of the model patient. The advisor also utilises population median values of the cardiac index and oxygen consumption index. This alleviates the need for invasive monitoring. In a simulation study, the mean squared error of the control using the ANFIS model was 0.75 kPa2 compared to 2.06 kPa2 using the linear regression model. Therefore, the performance of the FiO2 advisor was better when the shunt was estimated using the non-linear ANFIS model.

Athanasios Tsakonas,Georgios Dounias,Jan Jantzen,Hubertus Axer,Beth Bjerregaard,Diedrich Graf v. Keyserlingk	2004	"Objective: To demonstrate and compare the application of different genetic programming (GP) based intelligent methodologies for the construction of rule-based systems in two medical domains: the diagnosis of aphasia's subtypes and the classification of pap-smear examinations.Material: Past data representing (a) successful diagnosis of aphasia's subtypes from collaborating medical experts through a free interview per patient, and (b) correctly classified smears (images of cells) by cyto-technologists, previously stained using the Papanicolaou method.Methods: Initially a hybrid approach is proposed, which combines standard genetic programming and heuristic hierarchical crisp rule-base construction. Then, genetic programming for the production of crisp rule based systems is attempted. Finally, another hybrid intelligent model is composed by a grammar driven genetic programming system for the generation of fuzzy rule-based systems.Results: Results denote the effectiveness of the proposed systems, while they are also compared for their efficiency, accuracy and comprehensibility, to those of an inductive machine learning approach as well as to those of a standard genetic programming symbolic expression approach.Conclusion: The porposed GP-based intelligent methodologies are able to produce accurate and comprehensible results for medical experts performing competitive to other intelligent approaches. The aim of the authors was the production of accurate but also sensible decision rules that could potentially help medical doctors to extract conclusions, even at the expense of a higher classification score achievement"

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Enhancing performance of protein and gene name recognizers with filtering and integration strategies.	Wen-Juan Hou,Hsin-Hsi Chen	2004	Named entity (NE) recognition is a fundamental task in biological relationship mining. This paper considers protein/gene collocates extracted from biological corpora as restrictions to enhance the precision rate of protein/gene name recognition. In addition, we integrate the results of multiple NE recognizers to improve the recall rates. Yapex and KeX, and ABGene and Idgene are taken as examples of protein and gene name recognizers, respectively. The precision of Yapex increases from 70.90 to 85.84% at the low expense of the recall rate (i.e., it only decreases 2.44%) when collocates are incorporated. When both filtering and integration strategies are employed together, the Yapex-based integration with KeX shows good performance, i.e., the F-score increases by 7.83% compared to the pure Yapex method. The results of gene recognition show the same tendency. The ABGene-based integration with Idgene shows a 10.18% F-score increase compared to the pure ABGene method. These successful methodologies can be easily extended to other name finders in biological documents.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A computational TW3 classifier for skeletal maturity assessment. A approach.	Santiago Aja-Fernández,Rodrigo de Luis García,Miguel Ángel Martín-Fernández,Carlos Alberola-López	2004	This paper proposes a fuzzy methodology to translate the natural language descriptions of the TW3 method for bone age assessment into an automatic classifier. The classifier is built upon a modified version of a fuzzy ID3 decision tree. No large data records are needed to train the classifier, i.e., to find out the classification rules, since the classifier is built upon rules given by the TW3 method. Only small data records are needed to fine-tune the fuzzy sets used to implement the rulebase.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Cognitive schema and naturalistic decision making in evidence-based practices.	Paul R. Falzer	2004	"A recent article in this journal proposed a naturalistic approach to decision making that overcomes problems intrinsic to classical decision theory. The approach emphasizes cognitive and multi-level processes, the development of expert reasoning, and the role of decision support in individual and organizational decision making. The current paper builds on this effort by suggesting a naturalistic, multi-level, theory that can facilitate the dissemination of evidence-based practices (EBPs). The paper presents ""Image Theory,"" a theory that has been extensively investigated in other disciplines, but has yet to be utilized in medical decision research. It is suggested that its rich, empirically tested, distinctions among kinds of cognitive and organizational processes and types of decisions and tasks make Image Theory especially valuable in describing impediments to implementing EBPs. The paper discusses how naturalistic theory can assist clinicians, administrators, researchers, and policy makers in achieving a balance between evidence-based medicine and patient-centered practice."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Methods for automated concept mapping between medical databases.	Yao Sun	2004	"The retrieval and exchange of information between medical databases is often impeded by the semantic heterogeneity of concepts contained within the databases. Manual identification of equivalent database elements consumes time and resources, and may often be the rate-limiting technological step in integrating disparate data sources. By employing semantic networks as an intermediary representation of the native databases, automated mapping algorithms can identify equivalent concepts in disparate databases. The algorithms take advantage of the conceptual ""context"" embodied within a semantic network to produce candidate concept mappings. The performance of automated concept mapping was evaluated by creating semantic network representations for two test laboratory databases. The mapping algorithms identified all equivalent concepts that were present in the databases, and did not leave any equivalent concepts unmapped. The utilization of conceptual context to perform automated concept mapping facilitates the identification of equivalent database concepts and may help decrease the work and costs associated with retrieval and integration of information from disparate databases."

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Bioinformatics integration and agent technology.	Konstantinos Karasavvas,Richard A. Baldock,Albert Burger	2004	Vast amounts of life sciences data are scattered around the world in the form of a variety of heterogeneous data sources. The need to be able to co-relate relevant information is fundamental to increase the overall knowledge and understanding of a specific subject. Bioinformaticians aspire to find ways to integrate biological data sources for this purpose and system integration is a very important research topic. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of important integration issues that should be considered when designing a bioinformatics integration system. The currently prevailing approach for integration is presented with examples of bioinformatics information systems together with their main characteristics. Here, we introduce agent technology and we argue why it provides an appropriate solution for designing bioinformatics integration systems.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Discovering significant and interpretable patterns from multifactorial DNA microarray data with poor replication.	Ju Han Kim,Dooil Jeoung,Seongeun Lee,Hyeouneui Kim	2004	Motivation. Multivariate analyses are advantageous for the simultaneous testing of the separate and combined effects of many variables and of their interactions. In factorial designs with many factors and/or levels, however, sufficient replication is often prohibitively costly. Furthermore, complicated statements are often required for the biological interpretation of the higher-order interactions determined by standard statistical techniques like analysis of variance.Results. Because we are usually interested in finding factor-specific effects or their interactions, we assumed that the observed expression profile of a gene is a manifestation of an underlying factor-specific generative pattern (FSGP) combined with noise. Thus. a genetic algorithm was created to find the nearest FSGP for each expression profile. We then measured the distance between each profile and the corresponding nearest FSGP. Permutation testing for the distance measures successfully identified those genes with statistically significant profiles, thus yielding straightforward biological interpretations. Association networks of genes, drugs, and cell lines were created as tripartite graphs, representing significant and interpretable relations, by using a microarray experiment of gastric-cancer cell lines with a factorial design and no replication. The proposed method may benefit the combined analysis of heterogeneous expression data from the growing public repositories.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	GLIF3: a representation format for sharable computer-interpretable clinical practice guidelines.	Aziz A. Boxwala,Mor Peleg,Samson W. Tu,Omolola Ogunyemi,Qing T. Zeng,Dongwen Wang,Vimla L. Patel,Robert A. Greenes,Edward H. Shortliffe	2004	The Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF) is a model for representation of sharable computer-interpretable guidelines. The current version of GLIF (GLIF3) is a substantial update and enhancement of the model since the previous version (GLIF2). GLIF3 enables encoding of a guideline at three levels: a conceptual flowchart, a computable specification that can be verified for logical consistency and completeness, and an implementable specification that is intended to be incorporated into particular institutional information systems. The representation has been tested on a wide variety of guidelines that are typical of the range of guidelines in clinical use. It builds upon GLIF2 by adding several constructs that enable interpretation of encoded guidelines in computer-based decision-support systems. GLIF3 leverages standards being developed in Health Level 7 in order to allow integration of guidelines with clinical information systems. The GLIF3 specification consists of an extensible object-oriented model and a structured syntax based on the resource description framework (RDF). Empirical validation of the ability to generate appropriate recommendations using GLIF3 has been tested by executing encoded guidelines against actual patient data. GLIF3 is accordingly ready for broader experimentation and prototype use by organizations that wish to evaluate its ability to capture the logic of clinical guidelines, to implement them in clinical systems, and thereby to provide integrated decision support to assist clinicians.

This proposed technique is useful for preparing the data for classifiers that require nominal attributes. Experimental work on decision trees and naïve Bayes classifiers confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A simple and effective algorithm for detection of arbitrary Hartmann-Shack patterns.	Luis Alberto Carvalho	2004	"The Hartmann-Shack sensor is well known for its capability of detecting optical aberrations from telescopic images, normally caused by the atmospheric turbulence. Since the mid-1990s, this sensor has been adapted to work with ophthalmic instrumentation to measure aberrations of the human eye. In astronomical applications, the image processing is implemented using robust closed-loop hardware systems, allowing for very high frequencies (usually in the range of 30-500 Hz). In ophthalmic instruments, this hardware solution is not proper, for two reasons: first, prices of ophthalmic instrumentation have to be at more accessible prices and, second, there is no need for ultra-high frequency closed-loop systems: in fact, as we will see along the text, recent studies of the dynamics of the eye's aberrations show that closed-loop systems of very much lower frequencies (from 10 to 40 Hz) may well eliminate the undesired micro-fluctuations in the eye's aberrations and allow for diffraction limited measurements. We have developed an effective algorithm for detection of HS patterns using an affordable commercial hardware configuration and easy to implement software. To our knowledge, this type of information has not been thoroughly disclosed elsewhere, probably due to proprietary reasons."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Towards the development of a conceptual distance metric for the UMLS.	Jorge E. Caviedes,James J. Cimino	2004	The objective of this work is to investigate the feasibility of conceptual similarity metrics in the framework of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). We have investigated an approach based on the minimum number of parent links between concepts, and evaluated its performance relative to human expert estimates on three sets of concepts for three terminologies within the UMLS (i.e., MeSH, ICD9CM, and SNOMED). The resulting quantitative metric enables computer-based applications that use decision thresholds and approximate matching criteria. The proposed conceptual matching supports problem solving and inferencing (using high-level, generic concepts) based on readily available data (typically represented as low-level, specific concepts). Through the identification of semantically similar concepts, conceptual matching also enables reasoning in the absence of exact, or even approximate, lexical matching. Finally, conceptual matching is relevant for terminology development and maintenance, machine learning research, decision support system development, and data mining research in biomedical informatics and other fields.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Term identification in the biomedical literature.	Michael Krauthammer,Goran Nenadic	2004	Sophisticated information technologies are needed for effective data acquisition and integration from a growing body of the biomedical literature. Successful term identification is key to getting access to the stored literature information, as it is the terms (and their relationships) that convey knowledge across scientific articles. Due to the complexities of a dynamically changing biomedical terminology, term identification has been recognized as the current bottleneck in text mining, and--as a consequence--has become an important research topic both in natural language processing and biomedical communities. This article overviews state-of-the-art approaches in term identification. The process of identifying terms is analysed through three steps: term recognition, term classification, and term mapping. For each step, main approaches and general trends, along with the major problems, are discussed. By assessing previous work in context of the overall term identification process, the review also tries to delineate needs for future work in the field.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A primer on gene expression and microarrays for machine learning researchers.	Winston Patrick Kuo,Eun-Young Kim,Jeff Trimarchi,Tor-Kristian Jenssen,Staal A. Vinterbo,Lucila Ohno-Machado	2004	Data originating from biomedical experiments has provided machine learning researchers with an important source of motivation for developing and evaluating new algorithms. A new wave of algorithmic development has been initiated with the publication of gene expression data derived from microarrays. Microarray data analysis is particularly challenging given the large number of measurements (typically in the order of thousands) that are reported for relatively few samples (typically in the order of dozens). Many data sets are now available on the web. It is important that machine learning researchers understand how data are obtained and which assumptions are necessary in the analysis. Microarray data have the potential to cause significant impact in machine learning research, not just as a rich and realistic source of cases for testing new algorithms, as has been the UCI machine learning repository in the past decades, but also as a main motivation for their development. In this article, we briefly review the biology underlying microarrays, the process of obtaining gene expression measurements, and the rationale behind the common types of analyses involved in a microarray experiment. We outline the main challenges and reiterate critical considerations regarding the construction of supervised learning models that use this type of data. The goal of this article is to familiarize machine learning researchers with data originated from gene expression microarrays.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Fever detection from free-text clinical records for biosurveillance.	Wendy Webber Chapman,John N. Dowling,Michael M. Wagner	2004	Automatic detection of cases of febrile illness may have potential for early detection of outbreaks of infectious disease either by identification of anomalous numbers of febrile illness or in concert with other information in diagnosing specific syndromes, such as febrile respiratory syndrome. At most institutions, febrile information is contained only in free-text clinical records. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of three level detection algorithms for detecting fever from free-text. Keyword CC and CoCo classified patients based on triage chief complaints: Keyword HP classified patients based on dictated emergency department reports. Keyword HP was the most sensitive (sensitivity 0.98, specificity 0.89), and Keyword CC was the most specific (sensitivity 0.61, specificity 1.0). Because chief complaints are available sooner than emergency department reports, we suggest a combined application that classifies patients based on their chief complaint followed by classification based on their emergency department report, once the report becomes available.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Cognitive and usability engineering methods for the evaluation of clinical information systems.	André Kushniruk,Vimla L. Patel	2004	Increasingly healthcare policy and decision makers are demanding evidence to justify investments in health information systems. This demand requires an adequate evaluation of these systems. A wide variety of approaches and methodologies have been applied in assessing the impact of information systems in health care, ranging from controlled clinical trials to use of questionnaires and interviews with users. In this paper we describe methodological approaches which we have applied and refined for the past 10 years for the evaluation of health information systems. The approaches are strongly rooted in theories and methods from cognitive science and the emerging field of usability engineering. The focus is on assessing human computer interaction and in particular, the usability of computer systems in both laboratory and naturalistic settings. The methods described can be a part of the formative evaluation of systems during their iterative development, and can also complement more traditional assessment methods used in summative system evaluation of completed systems. The paper provides a review of the general area of systems evaluation with the motivation and rationale for methodological approaches underlying usability engineering and cognitive task analysis as applied to health information systems. This is followed by a detailed description of the methods we have applied in a variety of settings in conducting usability testing and usability inspection of systems such as computer-based patient records. Emerging trends in the evaluation of complex information systems are discussed.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Diagnostic fidelity of the Z-buffer segmentation algorithm: preliminary assessment based on intracranial aneurysm detection.	Brian E. Chapman,Dennis L. Parker,Janet O. Stapelton,Jay S. Tsuruda,Claudia Mello-Thoms,Bronwin Hamilton,Gregory L. Katzman,Kevin Moore	2004	We have developed an algorithm known as the Z-buffer segmentation (ZBS) algorithm for segmenting vascular structures from 3D MRA images. Previously we evaluated the accuracy of the ZBS algorithm on a voxel level in terms of inclusion and exclusion of vascular and background voxels. In this paper we evaluate the diagnostic fidelity of the ZBS algorithm. By diagnostic fidelity we mean that the data preserves the structural information necessary for diagnostic evaluation. This evaluation is necessary to establish the potential usefulness of the segmentation for improved image display, or whether the segmented data could form the basis of a computerized analysis tool. We assessed diagnostic fidelity by measuring how well human observers could detect aneurysms in the segmented data sets. ZBS segmentation of 30 MRA cases containing 29 aneurysms was performed. Image display used densitometric reprojections with shaded surface highlighting that were generated from the segmented data. Three neuroradiologists independently reviewed the generated ZBS images for aneurysms. The observers had 80% sensitivity (90% for aneurysms larger than 2 mm) with 0.13 false positives per image. Good agreement with the gold standard for describing aneurysm size and orientation was shown. These preliminary results suggest that the segmentation has diagnostic fidelity with the original data and may be useful for improved visualization or automated analysis of the vasculature.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Biomedical named entity recognition using two-phase model based on SVMs.	Ki-Joong Lee,Young-Sook Hwang,Seonho Kim,Hae-Chang Rim	2004	Named entity (NE) recognition has become one of the most fundamental tasks in biomedical knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we present a two-phase named entity recognizer based on SVMs, which consists of a boundary identification phase and a semantic classification phase of named entities. When adapting SVMs to named entity recognition, the multi-class problem and the unbalanced class distribution problem become very serious in terms of training cost and performance. We try to solve these problems by separating the NE recognition task into two subtasks, where we use appropriate SVM classifiers and relevant features for each subtask. In addition, by employing a hierarchical classification method based on ontology, we effectively solve the multiclass problem concerning semantic classification. The experimental results on the GENIA corpus show that the proposed method is effective not only in reducing computational cost but also in improving performance. The F-score (β = 1) for the boundary identification is 74.8 and the F-score for the semantic classification is 66.7.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Comparison of character-level and part of speech features for name recognition in biomedical texts.	Nigel Collier,Koichi Takeuchi	2004	"The immense volume of data which is now available from experiments in molecular biology has led to an explosion in reported results most of which are available only in unstructured text format. For this reason there has been great interest in the task of text mining to aid in fact extraction, document screening, citation analysis, and linkage with large gene and gene-product databases. In particular there has been an intensive investigation into the named entity (NE) task as a core technology in all of these tasks which has been driven by the availability of high volume training sets such as the GENIA v3.02 corpus. Despite such large training sets accuracy for biology NE has proven to be consistently far below the high levels of performance in the news domain where F scores above 90 are commonly reported which can be considered near to human performance. We argue that it is crucial that more rigorous analysis of the factors that contribute to the model's performance be applied to discover where the underlying limitations are and what our future research direction should be. Our investigation in this paper reports on variations of two widely used feature types, part of speech (POS) tags and character-level orthographic features, and makes a comparison of how these variations influence performance. We base our experiments on a proven state-of-the-art model, support vector machines using a high quality subset of 100 annotated MEDLINE abstracts. Experiments reveal that the best performing features are orthographic features with F score of 72.6. Although the Brill tagger trained in-domain on the GENIA v3.02p POS corpus gives the best overall performance of any POS tagger, at an F score of 68.6, this is still significantly below the orthographic features. In combination these two features types appear to interfere with each other and degrade performance slightly to an F score of 72.3."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	How (not) to protect genomic data privacy in a distributed network: using trail re-identification to evaluate and design anonymity protection systems.	Bradley Malin,Latanya Sweeney	2004	The increasing integration of patient-specific genomic data into clinical practice and research raises serious privacy concerns. Various systems have been proposed that protect privacy by removing or encrypting explicitly identifying information, such as name or social security number, into pseudonyms. Though these systems claim to protect identity from being disclosed, they lack formal proofs. In this paper, we study the erosion of privacy when genomic data, either pseudonymous or data believed to be anonymous, are released into a distributed healthcare environment. Several algorithms are introduced, collectively called RE-Identification of Data In Trails (REIDIT), which link genomic data to named individuals in publicly available records by leveraging unique features in patient-location visit patterns. Algorithmic proofs of re-identification are developed and we demonstrate, with experiments on real-world data, that susceptibility to re-identification is neither trivial nor the result of bizarre isolated occurrences. We propose that such techniques can be applied as system tests of privacy protection capabilities.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Induction of comprehensible models for gene expression datasets by subgroup discovery methodology.	Dragan Gamberger,Nada Lavrac,Filip Zelezný,Jakub Tolar	2004	Finding disease markers (classifiers) from gene expression data by machine learning algorithms is characterized by a high risk of overfitting the data due the abundance of attributes (simultaneously measured gene expression values) and shortage of available examples (observations). To avoid this pitfall and achieve predictor robustness, state-of-the-art approaches construct complex classifiers that combine relatively weak contributions of up to thousands of genes (attributes) to classify a disease. The complexity of such classifiers limits their transparency and consequently the biological insights they can provide. The goal of this study is to apply to this domain the methodology of constructing simple yet robust logic-based classifiers amenable to direct expert interpretation. On two well-known, publicly available gene expression classification problems, the paper shows the feasibility of this approach, employing a recently developed subgroup discovery methodology. Some of the discovered classifiers allow for novel biological interpretations.

Gardner	2004	"This article proposes using genomic information to help tailor the output of a drug interaction program for a patient. This paper focuses on a particular CYP450 enzyme to illustrate adding genomic information to an existing drug interaction database. The data are formatted as an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. The additional interaction information based on genomics for a patient is added to an XML document using XML tags. The suggestion is to combine specifics about a patient's genome with genomic information in the drug interactions database to increase the accuracy and details of a drug interaction program."

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Gene name identification and normalization using a model organism database.	Alexander A. Morgan,Lynette Hirschman,Marc E. Colosimo,Alexander S. Yeh,Jeffrey B. Colombe	2004	Biology has now become an information science, and researchers are increasingly dependent on expert-curated biological databases to organize the findings from the published literature. We report here on a series of experiments related to the application of natural language processing to aid in the curation process for FlyBase. We focused on listing the normalized form of genes and gene products discussed in an article. We broke this into two steps: gene mention tagging in text, followed by normalization of gene names. For gene mention tagging, we adopted a statistical approach. To provide training data, we were able to reverse engineer the gene lists from the associated articles and abstracts, to generate text labeled (imperfectly) with gene mentions. We then evaluated the quality of the noisy training data (precision of 78%, recall 88%) and the quality of the HMM tagger output trained on this noisy data (precision 78%, recall 71%). In order to generate normalized gene lists, we explored two approaches. First, we explored simple pattern matching based on synonym lists to obtain a high recall/low precision system (recall 95%, precision 2%). Using a series of filters, we were able to improve precision to 50% with a recall of 72% (balanced F-measure of 0.59). Our second approach combined the HMM gene mention tagger with various filters to remove ambiguous mentions; this approach achieved an F-measure of 0.72 (precision 88%, recall 61%). These experiments indicate that the lexical resources provided by FlyBase are complete enough to achieve high recall on the gene list task, and that normalization requires accurate disambiguation; different strategies for tagging and normalization trade off recall for precision.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Model-free functional MRI analysis based on unsupervised clustering.	Axel Wismüller,Anke Meyer-Bäse,Oliver Lange,Dorothee Auer,Maximilian F. Reiser,DeWitt Sumners	2004	"Conventional model-based or statistical analysis methods for functional MRI (fMRI) are easy to implement, and are effective in analyzing data with simple paradigms. However, they are not applicable in situations in which patterns of neural response are complicated and when fMRI response is unknown. In this paper the ""neural gas"" network is adapted and rigourosly studied for analyzing fMRI data. The algorithm supports spatial connectivity aiding in the identification of activation sites in functional brain imaging. A comparison of this new method with Kohonen's self-organizing map and with a fuzzy clustering scheme based on deterministic annealing is done in a systematic fMRI study showing comparative quantitative evaluations. The most important findings in this paper are: (1) both ""neural gas"" and the fuzzy clustering technique outperform Kohonen's map in terms of identifying signal components with high correlation to the fMRI stimulus. (2) the ""neural gas"" outperforms the two other methods with respect to the quantization error, and (3) Kohonen's map outperforms the two other methods in terms of computational expense. The applicability of the new algorithm is demonstrated on experimental data."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Multivariate image analysis in biomedicine.	Tim W. Nattkemper	2004	In recent years, multivariate imaging techniques are developed and applied in biomedical research in an increasing degree. In research projets and in clinical studies as well m-dimensional multivariate images (MVI) are recorded and stored to databases for a subsequent analysis. The complexity of the m-dimensional data and the growing number of high throughput applications call for new strategies for the application of image processing and data mining to support the direct interactive analysis by human experts. This article provides an overview of proposed approaches for MVI analysis in biomedicine. After summarizing the biomedical MVI techniques the two level framework for MVI analysis is illustrated. Following this framework, the state-of-the-art solutions from the fields of image processing and data mining are reviewed and discussed. Motivations for MVI data mining in biology and medicine are characterized, followed by an overview of graphical and auditory approaches for interactive data exploration. The paper concludes with summarizing open problems in MVI analysis and remarks upon the future development of biomedical MVI analysis.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Use of morphological analysis in protein name recognition.	Kaoru Yamamoto,Taku Kudo,Akihiko Konagaya,Yuji Matsumoto	2004	Protein name recognition aims to detect each and every protein names appearing in a PubMed abstract. The task is not simple, as the graphic word boundary (space separator) assumed in conventional preprocessing does not necessarily coincide with the protein name boundary. Such boundary disagreement caused by tokenization ambiguity has usually been ignored in conventional preprocessing of general English. In this paper, we argue that boundary disagreement poses serious limitations in biomedical English text processing, not to mention protein name recognition. Our key idea for dealing with the boundary disagreement is to apply techniques used in Japanese morphological analysis where there are no word boundaries. Having evaluated the proposed method with GENIA corpus 3.02, we obtain F-measure of 69.01 on a strict criterion and 79.32 on a relaxed criterion. The result is comparable to other published work in protein name recognition, without resorting to manually prepared ad hoc feature engineering. Further, compared to the conventional preprocessing, the use of morphological analysis as preprocessing improves the performance of protein name recognition and reduces the execution time.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Mapping high-dimensional data onto a relative distance plane - an exact method for visualizing and characterizing high-dimensional patterns.	Ray L. Somorjai,B. Dolenko,Aleksander B. Demko,M. Mandelzweig,A. E. Nikulin,Richard Baumgartner,Nicolino J. Pizzi	2004	We introduce a distance (similarity)--based mapping for the visualization of high-dimensional patterns and their relative relationships. The mapping preserves exactly the original distances between points with respect to any two reference patterns in a special two-dimensional coordinate system, the relative distance plane (RDP). As only a single calculation of a distance matrix is required, this method is computationally efficient, an essential requirement for any exploratory data analysis. The data visualization afforded by this representation permits a rapid assessment of class pattern distributions. In particular, we can determine with a simple statistical test whether both training and validation sets of a 2-class, high-dimensional dataset derive from the same class distributions. We can explore any dataset in detail by identifying the subset of reference pairs whose members belong to different classes, cycling through this subset, and for each pair, mapping the remaining patterns. These multiple viewpoints facilitate the identification and confirmation of outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on several complex biomedical datasets. Because of its efficiency, effectiveness, and versatility, one may use the RDP representation as an initial, data mining exploration that precedes classification by some classifier. Once final enhancements to the RDP mapping software are completed, we plan to make it freely available to researchers.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Identifying projected clusters from gene expression profiles.	Kevin Y. Yip,David W. Cheung,Michael K. Ng,Kei-Hoi Cheung	2004	In microarray gene expression data, clusters may hide in certain subspaces. For example, a set of co-regulated genes may have similar expression patterns in only a subset of the samples in which certain regulating factors are present. Their expression patterns could be dissimilar when measuring in the full input space. Traditional clustering algorithms that make use of such similarity measurements may fail to identify the clusters. In recent years a number of algorithms have been proposed to identify this kind of projected clusters, but many of them rely on some critical parameters whose proper values are hard for users to determine. In this paper, a new algorithm that dynamically adjusts its internal thresholds is proposed. It has a low dependency on user parameters while allowing users to input some domain knowledge should they be available. Experimental results show that the algorithm is capable of identifying some interesting projected clusters.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Using automatically learnt verb selectional preferences for classification of biomedical terms.	Irena Spasic,Sophia Ananiadou	2004	In this paper, we present an approach to term classification based on verb selectional patterns (VSPs), where such a pattern is defined as a set of semantic classes that could be used in combination with a given domain-specific verb. VSPs have been automatically learnt based on the information found in a corpus and an ontology in the biomedical domain. Prior to the learning phase, the corpus is terminologically processed: term recognition is performed by both looking up the dictionary of terms listed in the ontology and applying the C/NC-value method for on-the-fly term extraction. Subsequently, domain-specific verbs are automatically identified in the corpus based on the frequency of occurrence and the frequency of their co-occurrence with terms. VSPs are then learnt automatically for these verbs. Two machine learning approaches are presented. The first approach has been implemented as an iterative generalisation procedure based on a partial order relation induced by the domain-specific ontology. The second approach exploits the idea of genetic algorithms. Once the VSPs are acquired, they can be used to classify newly recognised terms co-occurring with domain-specific verbs. Given a term, the most frequently co-occurring domain-specific verb is selected. Its VSP is used to constrain the search space by focusing on potential classes of the given term. A nearest-neighbour approach is then applied to select a class from the constrained space of candidate classes. The most similar candidate class is predicted for the given term. The similarity measure used for this purpose combines contextual, lexical, and syntactic properties of terms.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Comprehensive vertical sample-based KNN/LSVM classification for gene expression analysis.	Fei Pan,Baoying Wang,Xin Hu,William Perrizo	2004	Classification analysis of microarray gene expression data has been widely used to uncover biological features and to distinguish closely related cell types that often appear in the diagnosis of cancer. However, the number of dimensions of gene expression data is often very high, e.g., in the hundreds or thousands. Accurate and efficient classification of such high-dimensional data remains a contemporary challenge. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive vertical sample-based KNN/LSVM classification approach with weights optimized by genetic algorithms for high-dimensional data. Experiments on common gene expression datasets demonstrated that our approach can achieve high accuracy and efficiency at the same time. The improvement of speed is mainly related to the vertical data representation, P-tree, and its optimized logical algebra. The high accuracy is due to the combination of a KNN majority voting approach and a local support vector machine approach that makes optimal decisions at the local level. As a result, our approach could be a powerful tool for high-dimensional gene expression data analysis.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Correspondence analysis of microarray time-course data in case-control design.	Qihua Tan,Klaus Brusgaard,Torben A. Kruse,Edward J. Oakeley,Brian A. Hemmings,Henning Beck-Nielsen,Lars Hansen,Michael Gaster	2004	Although different statistical approaches have been proposed for analyzing microarray time-course data, method for analyzing such data collected using the popular case-control design in clinical investigations has not been proposed perhaps due to the increased complexity for the existing parametric or non-parametric approaches. In this paper, we introduce a new multivariate data analyzing technique, the correspondence analysis, to analyze the high dimensional microarray time-course data in case-control design. We show, through an example on type 2 diabetes, how the nice features of the correspondence analysis can be use to explore the various time-course gene expression profiles that exist in the data. By coordinating and examining the projections on the reduced dimensions by both the genes and the time-course experiments, we are able to identify important genes and time-course patterns and make inferences on their biological relevance. Using the sample replicates, we propose a bootstrap procedure for inferring the significance of contributions on the leading dimensions by both the time-course experiments and the genes. Striking differences in the time-course patterns in the normal controls and diabetes patients have been revealed. In addition, the method also identifies genes that display similar or comparable time-course expression patterns shared by both the cases and the controls. We conclude that our correspondence analysis based approach can be a useful tool for analyzing high dimensional microarray data collected in clinical investigations.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A cognitive taxonomy of medical errors.	Jiajie Zhang,Vimla L. Patel,Todd R. Johnson,Edward H. Shortliffe	2004	Objective. Propose a cognitive taxonomy of medical errors at the level of individuals and their interactions with technology. Design. Use cognitive theories of human error and human action to develop the theoretical foundations of the taxonomy, develop the structure of the taxonomy, populate the taxonomy with examples of medical error cases, identify cognitive mechanisms for each category of medical error under the taxonomy, and apply the taxonomy to practical problems.Measurements. Four criteria were used to evaluate the cognitive taxonomy. The taxonomy should be able (1) to categorize major types of errors at the individual level along cognitive dimensions, (2) to associate each type of error with a specific underlying cognitive mechanism, (3) to describe how and explain why a specific error occurs, and (4) to generate intervention strategies for each type of error.Results. The proposed cognitive taxonomy largely satisfies the four criteria at a theoretical and conceptual level. Conclusion. Theoretically, the proposed cognitive taxonomy provides a method to systematically categorize medical errors at the individual level along cognitive dimensions, leads to a better understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms of medical errors, and provides a framework that can guide future studies on medical errors. Practically, it provides guidelines for the development of cognitive interventions to decrease medical errors and foundation for the development of medical error reporting system that not only categorizes errors but also identifies problems and helps to generate solutions. To validate this model empirically, we will next be performing systematic experimental studies.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Enhancing HMM-based biomedical named entity recognition by studying special phenomena.	Jie Zhang,Dan Shen,Guodong Zhou,Jian Su,Chew Lim Tan	2004	The purpose of this research is to enhance an HMM-based named entity recognizer in the biomedical domain. First, we analyze the characteristics of biomedical named entities. Then, we propose a rich set of features, including orthographic, morphological, part-of-speech, and semantic trigger features. All these features are integrated via a Hidden Markov Model with back-off modeling. Furthermore, we propose a method for biomedical abbreviation recognition and two methods for cascaded named entity recognition. Evaluation on the GENIA V3.02 and V1.1 shows that our system achieves 66.5 and 62.5 F-measure, respectively, and outperforms the previous best published system by 8.1 F-measure on the same experimental setting. The major contribution of this paper lies in its rich feature set specially designed for biomedical domain and the effective methods for abbreviation and cascaded named entity recognition. To our best knowledge, our system is the first one that copes with the cascaded phenomena.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Cancer classification and prediction using logistic regression with Bayesian gene selection.	Xiaobo Zhou,Kuang-Yu Liu,Stephen T. C. Wong	2004	In microarray-based cancer classification and prediction, gene selection is an important research problem owing to the large number of genes and the small number of experimental conditions. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to gene selection and classification using the logistic regression model. The basic idea of our approach is in conjunction with a logistic regression model to relate the gene expression with the class labels. We use Gibbs sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to discover important genes. To implement Gibbs Sampler and MCMC search, we derive a posterior distribution of selected genes given the observed data. After the important genes are identified, the same logistic regression model is then used for cancer classification and prediction. Issues for efficient implementation for the proposed method are discussed. The proposed method is evaluated against several large microarray data sets, including hereditary breast cancer, small round blue-cell tumors, and acute leukemia. The results show that the method can effectively identify important genes consistent with the known biological findings while the accuracy of the classification is also high. Finally, the robustness and sensitivity properties of the proposed method are also investigated.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Using name-internal and contextual features to classify biological terms.	Manabu Torii,Sachin Kamboj,K. Vijay-Shanker	2004	There has been considerable work done recently in recognizing named entities in biomedical text. In this paper, we investigate the named entity classification task, an integral part of the named entity extraction task. We focus on the different sources of information that can be utilized for classification, and note the extent to which they are effective in classification. To classify a name, we consider features that appear within the name as well as nearby phrases. We also develop a new strategy based on the context of occurrence and show that they improve the performance of the classification system. We show how our work relates to previous works on named entity classification in the biological domain as well as to those in generic domains. The experiments were conducted on the GENIA corpus Ver. 3.0 developed at University of Tokyo. We achieve f value of 86 in 10-fold cross validation evaluation on this corpus.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Incorporating ideas from computer-supported cooperative work.	Wanda Pratt,Madhu C. Reddy,David W. McDonald,Peter Tarczy-Hornoch,John H. Gennari	2004	Many information systems have failed when deployed into complex health-care settings. We believe that one cause of these failures is the difficulty in systematically accounting for the collaborative and exception-filled nature of medical work. In this methodological review paper, we highlight research from the field of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) that could help biomedical informaticists recognize and design around the kinds of challenges that lead to unanticipated breakdowns and eventual abandonment of their systems. The field of CSCW studies how people collaborate with each other and the role that technology plays in this collaboration for a wide variety of organizational settings. Thus, biomedical informaticists could benefit from the lessons learned by CSCW researchers. In this paper, we provide a focused review of CSCW methods and ideas we review aspects of the field that could be applied to improve the design and deployment of medical information systems. To make our discussion concrete, we use electronic medical record systems as an example medical information system, and present three specific principles from CSCW: accounting for incentive structures, understanding workflow, and incorporating awareness.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The aging of a clinical information system.	Roy Rada,Scott Finley	2004	"The senescence of a clinical information system is more likely to have administrative than technical bases. Supporting this claim is a case study of one aging oncology information system. The case study is qualitative, as behooves the subject matter. Content analysis of several documents suggests that the change in job description of the data coordinator led to a workflow breakdown. Next, twenty-two individuals were interviewed. Notes from the interviews were coded, and the resulting patterns led to • partial support for the workflow breakdown conjecture, • refutation of the hypothesis that users disliked the character-based, human-computer interface, • support of the conjecture that political rather than technical factors drive the usage patterns of the system, and • evidence that 'political' activity will determine the future of the information system.A stakeholder matrix is proposed that addresses administrative concerns. Also, the issue of the uniqueness of any oncology clinical information system is linked to the plans for this legacy system."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Classification and knowledge discovery in protein databases.	Predrag Radivojac,Nitesh V. Chawla,A. Keith Dunker,Zoran Obradovic	2004	"We consider the problem of classification in noisy, high-dimensional, and class-imbalanced protein datasets. In order to design a complete classification system, we use a three-stage machine learning framework consisting of a feature selection stage, a method addressing noise and class-imbalance, and a method for combining biologically related tasks through a prior-knowledge based clustering. In the first stage, we employ Fisher's permutation test as a feature selection filter. Comparisons with the alternative criteria show that it may be favorable for typical protein datasets. In the second stage, noise and class imbalance are addressed by using minority class over-sampling, majority class under-sampling, and ensemble learning. The performance of logistic regression models, decision trees, and neural networks is systematically evaluated. The experimental results show that in many cases ensembles of logistic regression classifiers may outperform more expressive models due to their robustness to noise and low sample density in a high-dimensional feature space. However, ensembles of neural networks may be the best solution for large datasets. In the third stage, we use prior knowledge to partition unlabeled data such that the class distributions among non-overlapping clusters significantly differ. In our experiments, training classifiers specialized to the class distributions of each cluster resulted in a further decrease in classification error."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Improving the performance of dictionary-based approaches in protein name recognition.	Yoshimasa Tsuruoka,Jun-ichi Tsujii	2004	Dictionary-based protein name recognition is often a first step in extracting information from biomedical documents because it can provide ID information on recognized terms. However, dictionary-based approaches present two fundamental difficulties: (1) false recognition mainly caused by short names; (2) low recall due to spelling variations. In this paper, we tackle the former problem using machine learning to filter out false positives and present two alternative methods for alleviating the latter problem of spelling variations. The first is achieved by using approximate string searching, and the second by expanding the dictionary with a probabilistic variant generator, which we propose in this paper. Experimental results using the GENIA corpus revealed that filtering using a naive Bayes classifier greatly improved precision with only a slight loss of recall, resulting in 10.8% improvement in F-measure, and dictionary expansion with the variant generator gave further 1.6% improvement and achieved an F-measure of 66.6%.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Design and implementation of the GLIF3 guideline execution engine.	Dongwen Wang,Mor Peleg,Samson W. Tu,Aziz A. Boxwala,Omolola Ogunyemi,Qing T. Zeng,Robert A. Greenes,Vimla L. Patel,Edward H. Shortliffe	2004	"We have developed the GLIF3 Guideline Execution Engine (GLEE) as a tool for executing guidelines encoded in the GLIF3 format. In addition to serving as an interface to the GLIF3 guideline representation model to support the specified functions, GLEE provides defined interfaces to electronic medical records (EMRs) and other clinical applications to facilitate its integration with the clinical information system at a local institution. The execution model of GLEE takes the ""system suggests, user controls"" approach. A tracing system is used to record an individual patient's state when a guideline is applied to that patient. GLEE can also support an event-driven execution model once it is linked to the clinical event monitor in a local environment. Evaluation has shown that GLEE can be used effectively for proper execution of guidelines encoded in the GLIF3 format. When using it to execute each guideline in the evaluation, GLEE's performance duplicated that of the reference systems implementing the same guideline but taking different approaches. The execution flexibility and generality provided by GLEE, and its integration with a local environment, need to be further evaluated in clinical settings. Integration of GLEE with a specific event-monitoring and order-entry environment is the next step of our work to demonstrate its use for clinical decision support. Potential uses of GLEE also include quality assurance, guideline development, and medical education."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A framework for a distributed, hybrid, multiple-ontology clinical-guideline library, and automated guideline-support tools.	Yuval Shahar,Ohad Young,Erez Shalom,Maya Galperin,Alon Mayaffit,Robert Moskovitch,Alon Hessing	2004	Clinical guidelines are a major tool in improving the quality of medical care. However, most guidelines are in free text, not in a formal, executable format, and are not easily accessible to clinicians at the point of care. We introduce a Web-based, modular, distributed architecture, the Digital Electronic Guideline Library (DeGeL), which facilitates gradual conversion of clinical guidelines from text to a formal representation in chosen target guideline ontology. The architecture supports guideline classification, semantic markup, context-sensitive search, browsing, run-time application, and retrospective quality assessment. The DeGeL hybrM meta-ontology includes elements common to all guideline ontologies, such as semantic classification and domain knowledge; it also includes four content-representation formats: free text, semi-structured text, semi-formal representation, and a formal representation. These formats support increasingly sophisticated computational tasks. The DeGeL tools for support of guideline-based care operate, at some level, on all guideline ontologies. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the architecture and the tools for several guideline ontologies, including Asbru and GEM.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	An ontology of randomized controlled trials for evidence-based practice: content specification and evaluation using the competency decomposition method.	Ida Sim,Ben Olasov,Simona Carini	2004	Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are one of the least biased sources of clinical research evidence, and are therefore a critical resource for the practice of evidence-based medicine. With over 10,000 new RCTs indexed in Medline each year, knowledge systems are needed to help clinicians translate evidence into practice. Common ontologies for RCTs and other domains would facilitate the development of these knowledge systems. However, no standard method exists for developing domain ontologies. In this paper, we describe a new systematic approach to specifying and evaluating the conceptual content of ontologies. In this method, called competency decomposition, the target task for an ontology is hierarchically decomposed into subtasks and methods, and the ontology content is specified by identifying the domain information required to complete each of the subtasks. We illustrate the use of this competency decomposition approach for the content specification and evaluation of an RCT ontology for evidence-based practice.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Summarization from medical documents: a survey.	Stergos D. Afantenos,Vangelis Karkaletsis,Panagiotis Stamatopoulos	2005	Objective:: The aim of this paper is to survey the recent work in medical documents summarization. Background:: During the last decade, documents summarization got increasing attention by the AI research community. More recently it also attracted the interest of the medical research community as well, due to the enormous growth of information that is available to the physicians and researchers in medicine, through the large and growing number of published journals, conference proceedings, medical sites and portals on the World Wide Web, electronic medical records, etc. Methodology:: This survey gives first a general background on documents summarization, presenting the factors that summarization depends upon, discussing evaluation issues and describing briefly the various types of summarization techniques. It then examines the characteristics of the medical domain through the different types of medical documents. Finally, it presents and discusses the summarization techniques used so far in the medical domain, referring to the corresponding systems and their characteristics. Discussion and conclusions:: The paper discusses thoroughly the promising paths for future research in medical documents summarization. It mainly focuses on the issue of scaling to large collections of documents in various languages and from different media, on personalization issues, on portability to new sub-domains, and on the integration of summarization technology in practical applications.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Classifying free-text triage chief complaints into syndromic categories with natural language processing.	Wendy Webber Chapman,Lee M. Christensen,Michael M. Wagner,Peter J. Haug,Oleg Ivanov,John N. Dowling,Robert T. Olszewski	2005	"Objective: Develop and evaluate a natural language processing application for classifying chief complaints into syndromic categories for syndromic surveillance.Introduction: Much of the input data for artificial intelligence applications in the medical field are free-text patient medical records, including dictated medical reports and triage chief complaints. To be useful for automated systems, the free-text must be translated into encoded form.Methods: We implemented a biosurveillance detection system from Pennsylvania to monitor the 2002 Winter Olympic Games. Because input data was in free-text format, we used a natural language processing text classifier to automatically classify free-text triage chief complaints into syndromic categories used by the biosurveillance system. The classifier was trained on 4700 chief complaints from Pennsylvania. We evaluated the ability of the classifier to classify free-text chief complaints into syndromic categories with a test set of 800 chief complaints from Utah.Results: The classifier produced the following areas under the ROC curve: Constitutional = 0.95; Gastrointestinal = 0.97; Hemorrhagic = 0.99; Neurological = 0.96; Rash = 1.0; Respiratory = 0.99; Other = 0.96. Using information stored in the system's semantic model, we extracted from the Respiratory classifications lower respiratory complaints and lower respiratory complaints with fever with a precision of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively.Conclusion: Results suggest that a trainable natural language processing text classifier can accurately extract data from free-text chief complaints for biosurveillance."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Logical analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.	Gabriela Alexe,Sorin Alexe,D. E. Axelrod,Peter L. Hammer,D. Weissmann	2005	Objective:: The goal of this study is to re-examine the oligonucleotide microarray dataset of Shipp et al. (www.genome.wi.mit.du/MPR/lymphoma), which contains the intensity levels of 6817 genes of 58 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and 19 with follicular lymphoma (FL), by means of the combinatorics, optimisation, and logic-based methodology of logical analysis of data (LAD). The motivations for this new analysis included the previously demonstrated capabilities of LAD and its expected potential (1) to identify different informative genes than those discovered by conventional statistical methods, (2) to identify combinations of gene expression levels capable of characterizing different types of lymphoma, and (3) to assemble collections of such combinations that if considered jointly are capable of accurately distinguishing different types of lymphoma. Methods and materials:: The central concept of LAD is a pattern or combinatorial biomarker, a concept that resembles a rule as used in decision tree methods. LAD is able to exhaustively generate the collection of all those patterns which satisfy certain quality constraints, through a systematic combinatorial process guided by clear optimization criteria. Then, based on a set covering approach, LAD aggregates the collection of patterns into classification models. In addition, LAD is able to use the information provided by large collections of patterns in order to extract subsets of variables, which collectively are able to distinguish between different types of disease. Results:: For the differential diagnosis of DLBCL versus FL, a model based on eight significant genes is constructed and shown to have a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 100% on the test set. For the prognosis of good versus poor outcome among the DLBCL patients, a model is constructed on another set consisting also of eight significant genes, and shown to have a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 90% on the test set. The genes selected by LAD also work well as a basis for other kinds of statistical analysis, indicating their robustness. Conclusion:: These two models exhibit accuracies that compare favorably to those in the original study. In addition, the current study also provides a ranking by importance of the genes in the selected significant subsets as well as a library of dozens of combinatorial biomarkers (i.e. pairs or triplets of genes) that can serve as a source of mathematically generated, statistically significant research hypotheses in need of biological explanation.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Discovering reliable protein interactions from high-throughput experimental data using network topology.	Jin Chen,Wynne Hsu,Mong-Li Lee,See-Kiong Ng	2005	"Objective:: Current protein-protein interaction (PPI) detection via high-throughput experimental methods, such as yeast-two-hybrid has been reported to be highly erroneous, leading to potentially costly spurious discoveries. This work introduces a novel measure called IRAP, i.e. ''interaction reliability by alternative path'', for assessing the reliability of protein interactions based on the underlying topology of the PPI network. Methods and materials:: A candidate PPI is considered to be reliable if it is involved in a closed loop in which the alternative path of interactions between the two interacting proteins is strong. We devise an algorithm called AlternativePathFinder to compute the IRAP value for each interaction in a complex PPI network. Validation of the IRAP as a measure for assessing the reliability of PPIs is performed with extensive experiments on yeast PPI data. All the data used in our experiments can be downloaded from our supplementary data web site at http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chenjin/data.html. Results:: Results show consistently that IRAP measure is an effective way for discovering reliable PPIs in large datasets of error-prone experimentally-derived PPIs. Results also indicate that IRAP is better than IG2, and markedly better than the more simplistic IG1 measure. Conclusion:: Experimental results demonstrate that a global, system-wide approach-such as IRAP that considers the entire interaction network instead of merely local neighbors-is a much more promising approach for assessing the reliability of PPIs."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Application of tabu search strategy for finding low energy structure of protein.	Jacek Blazewicz,Piotr Lukasiak,Maciej Milostan	2005	Objective:: Understanding protein functionality would mean understanding the basics of life. This functionality follows a three-dimensional structure of proteins. Unfortunately till now it is not possible to obtain these structures artificially. This article offers a survey on the use of meta-heuristic methods in context of simplified models of protein folding. Methods:: Tabu search (TS) strategy is one of the most successful meta-heuristics that has been applied for large number of optimization problems. In the paper, the application of TS for finding low energy conformations of proteins in a simplified lattice model has been proposed. Results:: The algorithm has been extensively tested and the tests showed its good performance. It compares well with the other heuristic approaches. Conclusions:: The approach presented is competitive as compared with other methods and due to its low computation time can be used as a complementary tool for an analysis of the three-dimensional protein structures.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	A framework for distributed mediation of temporal-abstraction queries to clinical databases.	David Boaz,Yuval Shahar	2005	Objective:: The specification and creation of a distributed system that integrates medical knowledge bases with time-oriented clinical databases; the goal is to answer complex temporal queries regarding both raw data and its abstractions, such as are often required in medical applications. Methods:: (1) Specification, design, and implementation of a generalized access method to a set of heterogeneous clinical data sources, by using a virtual medical-record interface and by mapping the local terms to a set of standardized medical vocabularies; (2) specification of a generalized interface to a set of knowledge sources; (3) specification and implementation of a service, called ALMA that computes complex time-oriented medical queries that include both raw data and abstractions derivable from it; (4) design and implementation of a mediator, called IDAN, that answers raw-data and abstract queries by integrating the appropriate clinical data with the relevant medical knowledge and uses the computation service to answer the queries; (5) an expressive language that enables definition of time-dependent medical queries, which are referred to the mediator; (6) evaluation of the effect of the system, when combined with a new visual interface, called KNAVE-II, on the speed and accuracy of answering a set of complex queries in an oncology sub domain, by a group of clinicians, compared to answering these queries using paper or an electronic spreadsheet. Results:: We have implemented the full IDAN architecture. The IDAN/KNAVE-II combination significantly increased the accuracy and speed of answering complex queries about both the data and their abstractions, compared to the standard tools. Conclusion:: The implemented architecture proves the feasibility of the distributed integration of medical knowledge sources with clinical data of heterogeneous sources. The results suggest that the proposed IDAN modular architecture has potential significance for supporting the automation of clinical tasks such as diagnosis, monitoring, therapy, and quality assessment.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	"Fuzzy attributes of a DNA complex: Development of a fuzzy inference engine for codon-""junk"" codon delineation."	Tomás Arredondo Vidal,Perambur S. Neelakanta,Dolores F. De Groff	2005	"Objective:: The present study is concerned with the need that exists in bioinformatics to identify and delineate overlapping codon and noncodon structures in a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) complex so as to ascertain the boundary of separation between them. Codons refer to those parts in a DNA complex encoded towards forming a desired set of proteins. Also coexist in the DNA structure noncodons (or ''junk'' codons), whose functions are not so well defined. Such codon and noncodon parts (at least over some sections of a DNA chain) may conform to diffused (overlapping) states exhibiting sharpless boundaries with indistinctive statistics of occurrence of their constituents. Such overlapping mix of codon and noncodon entities constitutes a (fuzzy) universe with information constituent having a fuzzy structure, which can only be identified in descriptive norms with characteristic membership of belongingness to certain attributes. Hence, this work is directed to develop a fuzzy inference engine (FIE), which delineates the fuzzy codon-noncodon parts. Methods and material:: Relevant algorithms developed for the fuzzy inference in question are based on information-theoretic (IT) considerations applied to symbolic as well as binary sequence data representing the DNA. Pseudocodes, as needed are furnished. Results:: Simulated studies using human and other bacterial codon statistics are presented to illustrate the efficacy of the approach pursued. The outcome of the study is illustrated via tabulated results and graphs depicting the delineation sought. Conclusion:: The results signify the success of IT-approach pursued in delineating imprecise codon/noncodon boundaries. The FIE applies both for human and bacterial codon statistics."

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Temporal reasoning for decision support in medicine.	Juan Carlos Augusto	2005	Objective: Handling time-related concepts is essential in medicine. During diagnosis it can make a substantial difference to know the temporal order in which some symptoms occurred or for how long they lasted. During prognosis the potential evolutions of a disease are conceived as a description of events unfolding in time. In therapy planning the different steps of treatment must be applied in a precise order, with a given frequency and for a certain span of time in order to be effective. This article offers a survey on the use of temporal reasoning for decision support-related tasks in medicine.Material and methods: Key publications of the area, mainly circumscribed to the latest two decades, are reviewed and classified according to three important stages of patient treatment requiring decision support: diagnosis, prognosis and therapy planning/management. Other complementary publications, like those on time-centered information storage and retrieval, are also considered as they provide valuable support to the above mentioned three stages.Results: Key areas are highlighted and used to organize the latest contributions. The survey of previous research is followed by an analysis of what can still be improved and what is needed to make the next generation of decision support systems for medicine more effective.Conclusions: It can be observed that although the area has been considerably developed, there are still areas where more research is needed to make time-based systems of widespread use in decision support-related areas of medicine. Several suggestions for further exploration are proposed as a result of the survey.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Using cognitive task analysis to facilitate the integration of decision support systems into the neonatal intensive care unit.	Gordon D. Baxter,Andrew F. Monk,Kenneth Tan,Peter R. F. Dear,Simon J. Newell	2005	"Objective: New medical systems may be rejected by staff because they do not integrate with local practice. An expert system, FLORENCE, is being developed to help staff in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) make decisions about ventilator settings when treating babies with respiratory distress syndrome. For FLORENCE to succeed it must be clinically useful and acceptable to staff in the context of local work practices. The aim of this work was to identify those contextual factors that would affect FLORENCE's success. Methods: A cognitive task analysis (CTA) of the NICU was performed. First, work context analysis was used to identify how work is performed in the NICU. Second, the critical decision method (CDM) was used to analyse how staff make decisions about changing the ventilator settings. Third, naturalistic observation of staff's use of the ventilator was performed. Results: A. The work context analysis identified the NICU's hierarchical communication structure and the importance of numerous types of record in communication. B. It also identified important ergonomic and practical requirements for designing the displays and positioning the computer. C. The CDM interviews suggested instances where problems can arise if the data used by FLORENCE, which is automatically read, is not manually verified. D. Observation showed that most alarms cleared automatically. When FLORENCE raises an alarm staff will normally be required to intervene and make a clinical judgement, even if the ventilator settings are not subsequently changed. Conclusions: FLORENCE must not undermine the NICU's hierarchical communication channels (A). The re-design of working practices to incorporate FLORENCE, reinforced through its user interface, must ensure that expert help is called on when appropriate (A). The procedures adopted with FLORENCE should ensure that the data the advice is based upon is valid (C). For example, FLORENCE could prompt staff to manually verify the data before implementing any suggested changes. FLORENCE's audible alarm should be clearly distinguishable from other NICU alarms (D); new procedures should be established to ensure that FLORENCE alarms receive attention (D), and false alarms from FLORENCE should be minimised (B, D). FLORENCE should always provide the data and reasoning underpinning its advice (A, C, D). The methods used in the CTA identified several contextual issues that could affect FLORENCE's acceptance. These issues, which extend beyond FLORENCE's capability to suggest changes to the ventilator settings, are being addressed in the design of the user interface and plans for FLORENCE's subsequent deployment. nt."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Comparative experiments on learning information extractors for proteins and their interactions.	Razvan C. Bunescu,Ruifang Ge,Rohit J. Kate,Edward M. Marcotte,Raymond J. Mooney,Arun K. Ramani,Yuk Wah Wong	2005	Objective:: Automatically extracting information from biomedical text holds the promise of easily consolidating large amounts of biological knowledge in computer-accessible form. This strategy is particularly attractive for extracting data relevant to genes of the human genome from the 11 million abstracts in Medline. However, extraction efforts have been frustrated by the lack of conventions for describing human genes and proteins. We have developed and evaluated a variety of learned information extraction systems for identifying human protein names in Medline abstracts and subsequently extracting information on interactions between the proteins. Methods and Material:: We used a variety of machine learning methods to automatically develop information extraction systems for extracting information on gene/protein name, function and interactions from Medline abstracts. We present cross-validated results on identifying human proteins and their interactions by training and testing on a set of approximately 1000 manually-annotated Medline abstracts that discuss human genes/proteins. Results:: We demonstrate that machine learning approaches using support vector machines and maximum entropy are able to identify human proteins with higher accuracy than several previous approaches. We also demonstrate that various rule induction methods are able to identify protein interactions with higher precision than manually-developed rules. Conclusion:: Our results show that it is promising to use machine learning to automatically build systems for extracting information from biomedical text. The results also give a broad picture of the relative strengths of a wide variety of methods when tested on a reasonably large human-annotated corpus.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Merging multimedia presentations and semistructured temporal data: a graph-based model and its application to clinical information.	Carlo Combi,Barbara Oliboni,Rosalba Rossato	2005	Objective:: In this paper, we focus on the issue of providing physicians with the capability of representing in a seamless way both temporal aspects of multimedia semistructured data and their temporal presentation requirements. Background:: Semistructured data are data having some structure, that may be irregular or incomplete and does not necessarily conform to a fixed schema. Semistructured data often contain the description of histories of the considered real world. The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is becoming a cross compatible and standardized means for representing semistructured clinical data. In the field of medical informatics, there are many ongoing activities concerning XML. In the field of multimedia database systems, the topic related to the integration of several media objects (with their temporal aspects) have been considered both for data modeling and querying issues and for modeling multimedia presentations. Methodology:: We first propose the Multimedia Temporal Graphical Model (MTGM), by representing a clinical database for cardiology patients undergoing cardiac angiographies and then describe it in a formal way. We deal with the problem of expressing MTGM data by XML and of managing MTGM clinical data through an XML-based system. We provide both a technique for translating (a part of) an MTGM database into an XML document and some techniques allowing us to obtain presentations defined by means of the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) from MTGM presentations. Results:: MTGM allows one to represent and store clinical information in a semistructured, temporal, and multimedia database. The physician can define multimedia presentations based on the stored data. Multimedia presentations are then stored in the same MTGM database together with temporal clinical information and are thus represented according to the same data model. A prototype based on an XML native database system has been designed and implemented. Discussion and conclusions:: In this work we have considered the theoretical and methodological issues concerning the definition of a general data model for describing temporal and multimedia features of semistructured clinical information. Other research and application oriented features, which have not been considered in MTGM, could be investigated for completing MTGM with regard to its applicability to clinical domains: MTGM does not allow one to express times at different levels of granularities, i.e. with different time units, or with indeterminacy; besides the considered valid time, it could be interesting to manage also other temporal dimensions such as the transaction and availability times. Besides being useful for managing multimedia data stored according to widely accepted standards as MPEG and DICOM, nowadays semistructured data, and XML in particular, are becoming the most important way for expressing and exchanging medical knowledge and data: MTGM can be considered as a data model allowing the seamless representation of both (multimedia and temporal) clinical data and knowledge.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Temporal data mining for the quality assessment of hemodialysis services.	Riccardo Bellazzi,Cristiana Larizza,Paolo Magni,Roberto Bellazzi	2005	"Objective:: This paper describes the temporal data mining aspects of a research project that deals with the definition of methods and tools for the assessment of the clinical performance of hemodialysis (HD) services, on the basis of the time series automatically collected during hemodialysis sessions. Methods:: Intelligent data analysis and temporal data mining techniques are applied to gain insight and to discover knowledge on the causes of unsatisfactory clinical results. In particular, two new methods for association rule discovery and temporal rule discovery are applied to the time series. Such methods exploit several pre-processing techniques, comprising data reduction, multi-scale filtering and temporal abstractions. Results:: We have analyzed the data of more than 5800 dialysis sessions coming from 43 different patients monitored for 19 months. The qualitative rules associating the outcome parameters and the measured variables were examined by the domain experts, which were able to distinguish between rules confirming available background knowledge and unexpected but plausible rules. Conclusion:: The new methods proposed in the paper are suitable tools for knowledge discovery in clinical time series. Their use in the context of an auditing system for dialysis management helped clinicians to improve their understanding of the patients' behavior."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Description logic-based methods for auditing frame-based medical terminological systems.	Ronald Cornet,Ameen Abu-Hanna	2005	Objective:: Medical terminological systems (TSs) play an increasingly important role in health care by supporting recording, retrieval and analysis of patient information. As the size and complexity of TSs are growing, the need arises for means to audit them, i.e. verify and maintain (logical) consistency and (semantic) correctness of their contents. This is not only important for the management of TSs but also for providing their users with confidence about the reliability of their contents. Formal methods have the potential to play an important role in the audit of TSs, although there are few empirical studies to assess the benefits of using these methods. Methods and material:: In this paper we propose a method based on description logics (DLs) for the audit of TSs. This method is based on the migration of the medical TS from a frame-based representation to a DL-based one. Our method is characterized by a process in which initially stringent assumptions are made about concept definitions. The assumptions allow the detection of concepts and relations that might comprise a source of logical inconsistency. If the assumptions hold then definitions are to be altered to eliminate the inconsistency, otherwise the assumptions are revised. Results:: In order to demonstrate the utility of the approach in a real-world case study we audit a TS in the intensive care domain and discuss decisions pertaining to building DL-based representations. This case study demonstrates that certain types of inconsistencies can indeed be detected by applying the method to a medical terminological system. Conclusion:: The added value of the method described in this paper is that it provides a means to evaluate the compliance to a number of common modeling principles in a formal manner. The proposed method reveals potential modeling inconsistencies, helping to audit and (if possible) improve the medical TS. In this way, it contributes to providing confidence in the contents of the terminological system.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Constraint reasoning in deep biomedical models.	Jorge Cruz,Pedro Barahona	2005	Objective:: Deep biomedical models are often expressed by means of differential equations. Despite their expressive power, they are difficult to reason about and make decisions, given their non-linearity and the important effects that the uncertainty on data may cause. The objective of this work is to propose a constraint reasoning framework to support safe decisions based on deep biomedical models. Method:: The methods used in our approach include the generic constraint propagation techniques for reducing the bounds of uncertainty of the numerical variables complemented with new constraint reasoning techniques that we developed to handle differential equations. Results:: The results of our approach are illustrated in biomedical models for the diagnosis of diabetes, tuning of drug design and epidemiology where it was a valuable decision-supporting tool notwithstanding the uncertainty on data. Conclusion:: The main conclusion that follows from the results is that, in biomedical decision support, constraint reasoning may be a worthwhile alternative to traditional simulation methods, especially when safe decisions are required.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Automatic processing of multilingual medical terminology: applications to thesaurus enrichment and cross-language information retrieval.	Hervé Déjean,Éric Gaussier,Jean-Michel Renders,Fatiha Sadat	2005	Objectives:: We present in this article experiments on multi-language information extraction and access in the medical domain. For such applications, multilingual terminology plays a crucial role when working on specialized languages and specific domains. Material and methods:: We propose firstly a method for enriching multilingual thesauri which extracts new terms from parallel corpora, and secondly, a new approach for bilingual lexicon extraction from comparable corpora, which uses a bilingual thesaurus as a pivot. We illustrate their use in multi-language information retrieval (English/German) in the medical domains. Results:: Our experiments show that these automatically extracted bilingual lexicons are accurate enough (85% precision for term extraction) for semi-automatically enriching mono- or bi-lingual thesauri such as the universal medical language system, and that their use in cross-language information retrieval significantly improves the retrieval performance (from 22 to 40% average precision) and clearly outperforms existing bilingual lexicon resources (both general lexicons and specialized ones). Conclusion:: We show in this paper first that bilingual lexicon extraction from parallel corpora in the medical domain could lead to accurate, specialized lexicons, which can be used to help enrich existing thesauri and second that bilingual lexicons extracted from comparable corpora outperform general bilingual resources for cross-language information retrieval.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Predicting breast cancer survivability: a comparison of three data mining methods.	Dursun Delen,Glenn Walker,Amit Kadam	2005	Objective:: The prediction of breast cancer survivability has been a challenging research problem for many researchers. Since the early dates of the related research, much advancement has been recorded in several related fields. For instance, thanks to innovative biomedical technologies, better explanatory prognostic factors are being measured and recorded; thanks to low cost computer hardware and software technologies, high volume better quality data is being collected and stored automatically; and finally thanks to better analytical methods, those voluminous data is being processed effectively and efficiently. Therefore, the main objective of this manuscript is to report on a research project where we took advantage of those available technological advancements to develop prediction models for breast cancer survivability. Methods and material:: We used two popular data mining algorithms (artificial neural networks and decision trees) along with a most commonly used statistical method (logistic regression) to develop the prediction models using a large dataset (more than 200,000 cases). We also used 10-fold cross-validation methods to measure the unbiased estimate of the three prediction models for performance comparison purposes. Results:: The results indicated that the decision tree (C5) is the best predictor with 93.6% accuracy on the holdout sample (this prediction accuracy is better than any reported in the literature), artificial neural networks came out to be the second with 91.2% accuracy and the logistic regression models came out to be the worst of the three with 89.2% accuracy. Conclusion:: The comparative study of multiple prediction models for breast cancer survivability using a large dataset along with a 10-fold cross-validation provided us with an insight into the relative prediction ability of different data mining methods. Using sensitivity analysis on neural network models provided us with the prioritized importance of the prognostic factors used in the study.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Gene extraction for cancer diagnosis by support vector machines - An improvement.	Te Ming Huang,Vojislav Kecman	2005	"Objective:: To improve the performance of gene extraction for cancer diagnosis by recursive feature elimination with support vector machines (RFE-SVMs): A cancer diagnosis by using the DNA microarray data faces many challenges the most serious one being the presence of thousands of genes and only several dozens (at the best) of patient's samples. Thus, making any kind of classification in high-dimensional spaces from a limited number of data is both an extremely difficult and a prone to an error procedure. The improved RFE-SVMs is introduced and used here for an elimination of less relevant genes and just for a reduction of the overall number of genes used in a medical diagnostic. Methods:: The paper shows why and how the, usually neglected, penalty parameter C and some standard data preprocessing techniques (normalizing and scaling) influence classification results and the gene selection of RFE-SVMs. The gene selected by RFE-SVMs is compared with eight other gene selection algorithms implemented in the Rankgene software to investigate whether there is any consensus among the algorithms, so the scope of finding the right set of genes can be reduced. Results:: The improved RFE-SVMs is applied on the two benchmarking colon and lymphoma cancer data sets with various C parameters and different standard preprocessing techniques. Here, decreasing C leads to the smaller diagnosis error in comparisons to other known methods applied to the benchmarking data sets. With an appropriate parameter C and with a proper preprocessing procedure, the reduction in a diagnosis error is as high as 36%. Conclusions:: The results suggest that with a properly chosen parameter C, the extracted genes and the constructed classifier will ensure less overfitting of the training data leading to an increased accuracy in selecting relevant genes. Finally, comparison in gene ranking obtained by different algorithms shows that there is a significant consensus among the various algorithms as to which set of genes is relevant."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Do physicians value decision support? A look at the effect of decision support systems on physician opinion.	Stephan Dreiseitl,Michael Binder	2005	"Objective: Clinical decision support systems are on the verge of becoming routine software tools in clinical settings. We investigate the question of how physicians react when faced with decision support suggestions that contradict their own diagnoses.Methodology: We used a study design involving 52 volunteer dermatologists who each rated the malignancy of 25 lesion images on an ordinal scale and gave a dichotomous excise/no excise recommendation for each lesion image. After seeing the system's rating and excise suggestions, the physicians could revise their initial recommendations.Results: We observed that in 24% of the cases in which the physicians' diagnoses did not match those of the decision support system, the physicians changed their diagnoses. There was a slight but significant negative correlation between susceptibility to change and experience level of the physicians. Physicians were significantly less likely to follow the decision system's recommendations when they were confident of their initial diagnoses. No differences between the physicians' inclinations to following excise versus no excise recommendations could be observed.Conclusion: These results indicate that physicians are quite susceptible to accepting the recommendations of decision support systems, and that quality assurance and validation of such systems is therefore of paramount importance."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	SiMCAL 1 algorithm for analysis of gene expression data related to the phosphatidylserine receptor.	Daniel Dvorkin,Valerie Fadok,Krzysztof J. Cios	2005	Objective:: SiMCAL 1 (simple multilevel clustering and linking, version 1) is a novel clustering algorithm for time-series microarray data, presented here with an application to a specific data set. The purpose of the algorithm is to present a complete feature set not found in either Jarvis-Patrick clustering, from which it is derived, or in other popular clustering methods such as hierarchical and k-means. The data concern the activity of the phosphatidylserine receptor (PSR) which is believed to be a crucial molecular switch in the mediation of inflammatory response in apoptosis and lysis. By analyzing the behavior of PSR-related genes in mouse macrophages, we hope to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this important biological process. Methods and materials:: SiMCAL 1 is implemented in the Python programming language using the Numerical Python extensions, and the data are stored using the MySQL database management system. The data are derived from exposures of multiple Affymetrix mouse gene microarray chips to elevated levels of PSR antibody and control conditions. Code and data are available at http://www.dvorkin.com/daniel/Simcal1.zip (accessed: 17 January 2005). Results:: The algorithm meets its objectives: it is simple, in that it is computationally inexpensive; it is multilevel, in that it provides a small number of clearly defined hierarchical levels of clusters; and it offers linking between clusters at the same level in each hierarchy. Clustering and linking results indicate previously unknown co-regulation for genes expressing PGH synthase (COX2) and PGE2, appear to confirm increased production of proteins for clearance of apoptotic cells in the presence of PSR antibody, and correspond to other findings regarding the temporal relationship between PGE2 production and B cell proliferation and differentiation. These results are promising but should be taken as highly preliminary. Conclusion:: Both the algorithm and its application to this problem show great potential for future development. We plan to improve and extend the SiMCAL family of algorithms, and to obtain new data so that the algorithm(s) may be further applied to this and other problems of interest.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Customization in a unified framework for summarizing medical literature.	Noemie Elhadad,Min-Yen Kan,Judith L. Klavans,Kathleen McKeown	2005	Objective:: We present the summarization system in the PErsonalized Retrieval and Summarization of Images, Video and Language (PERSIVAL) medical digital library. Although we discuss the context of our summarization research within the PERSIVAL platform, the primary focus of this article is on strategies to define and generate customized summaries. Methods and material:: Our summarizer employs a unified user model to create a tailored summary of relevant documents for either a physician or lay person. The approach takes advantage of regularities in medical literature text structure and content to fulfill identified user needs. Results:: The resulting summaries combine both machine-generated text and extracted text that comes from multiple input documents. Customization includes both group-based modeling for two classes of users, physician and lay person, and individually driven models based on a patient record. Conclusions:: Our research shows that customization is feasible in a medical digital library.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	A new method for sleep apnea classification using wavelets and feedforward neural networks.	Oscar Fontenla-Romero,Bertha Guijarro-Berdiñas,Amparo Alonso-Betanzos,Vicente Moret-Bonillo	2005	"Objectives:: This paper presents a novel approach for sleep apnea classification. The goal is to classify each apnea in one of three basic types: obstructive, central and mixed. Materials and methods:: Three different supervised learning methods using a neural network were tested. The inputs of the neural network are the first level-5-detail coefficients obtained from a discrete wavelet transformation of the samples (previously detected as apnea) in the thoracic effort signal. In order to train and test the systems, 120 events from six different patients were used. The true error rate was estimated using a 10-fold cross validation. The results presented in this work were averaged over 100 different simulations and a multiple comparison procedure was used for model selection. Results:: The method finally selected is based on a feedforward neural network trained using the Bayesian framework and a cross-entropy error function. The mean classification accuracy, obtained over the test set was 83.78+/-1.90%. Conclusion:: The proposed classifier surpasses, up to the author's knowledge, other previous results. Finally, a scheme to maintain and improve this system during its clinical use is also proposed."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Prediction of MHC class II binders using the ant colony search strategy.	Oleksiy Karpenko,Jianming Shi,Yang Dai	2005	Objective:: Predictions of the binding ability of antigen peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are important in vaccine development. The variable length of each binding peptide complicates this prediction. Methodology:: Motivated by the search properties of the ant colony system (ACS), a method for the identification of an alignment for a given set of short protein peptides has been developed. This alignment is further used for the derivation of a position specific scoring matrix. The distinguishing feature of this method is the use of the collective optimized search strategy of ants for the selection of the alignment. Results:: The performance of the new model has been evaluated with several benchmark datasets. It achieves better or comparable results as compared to the performance of existing methods. Conclusion:: The experiments demonstrate that the predictive performance of the scoring matrix embodies several promising characteristics.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	An adaptive window width/center adjustment system with online training capabilities for MR images.	Shang-Hong Lai,Ming Fang	2005	Objective: Adaptive and automatic adjustment of the display window parameters for magnetic resonance images under different viewing conditions is a challenging problem in medical image perception. An adaptive hierarchical neural network-based system with online adaptation capabilities is presented to achieve this goal in this paper.Methodology: The online adaptation capabilities are primarily attributed to the use of the hierarchical neural networks and the development of a new width/center mapping algorithm. The large training image set is hierarchically organized for efficient user interaction and effective re-mapping of the width/center settings. The width/center mapping functions are estimated from the new user-adjusted width/center values of some representative images by using a global spline function for the entire training images as well as a first-order polynomial function for each selected image sequence. The hierarchical neural networks are then re-trained for the new training data set after this mapping process.Results: The proposed automatic display window parameter adjustment system is implemented as a program on a personal computer for testing its adaptation performance. Experimental results show that the proposed system can successfully adapt its parameter adjustment on a variety of MR images after user readjustment and re-training of neural networks.Conclusion: This demonstrates the effective adaptation capabilities of the proposed system based on the framework of training data mapping and neural network retraining.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Finding the biologically optimal alignment of multiple sequences.	Hiroshi Mamitsuka	2005	Objective:: Deterministic annealing, which is derived from statistical physics, is a method for obtaining the global optimum in parameter space. During the annealing process, starting from high temperatures which are then lowered, deterministic annealing deterministically find the (global) optimum at each temperature. Thus, deterministic annealing is expected to be more computationally efficient than stochastic sampling strategies to obtain the global optimum. We propose to apply the deterministic annealing technique to the problem of efficiently finding the biologically optimal alignment of multiple sequences. Methods and material:: We take a strategy based on probabilistic models for aligning multiple sequences. That is, we train a probabilistic model using given training sequences and obtain their alignment by parsing, i.e. searching for the most likely parse of each sequence and gaps using the trained parameters of the model. In this scenario, we propose a new stochastic model, which is simple enough to be suited to multiple sequence alignment and, unlike existing stochastic models, say a profile hidden Markov model (HMM), allows us to use similarity scores between symbols (or a symbol and a gap). We further present a learning algorithm for our simple model by combining deterministic annealing with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We emphasize that our approach is time-efficient, even if the training is done through an annealing process. Results:: In our experiments, we used actual protein sequences whose three-dimensional (3D) structures are determined and which are all aligned based on their 3D structures. We compared the results obtained by our approach with those by other existing approaches. Experimental results clearly showed that our approach gave the best performance, in terms of the similarity to the structurally determined alignment, among the approaches tested. Experimental results further indicated that our approach was ten times more efficient in terms of actual computation time than a competing method.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Neural network predictions of significant coronary artery stenosis in men.	Bert A. Mobley,Eliot Schechter,William E. Moore,Patrick A. McKee,June E. Eichner	2005	Objective:: A neural network system was designed to predict whether coronary arteriography on a given patient would reveal any occurrence of significant coronary stenosis (>50%), a degree of stenosis which often leads to coronary intervention. Methodology:: A dataset of 2004 records from male cardiology patients was derived from a national cardiac catheterization database. The catheterizations selected for analysis from the database were first-time and elective, and they were precipitated by chest pain. Eleven patient variables were used as inputs in an artificial neural network system. The network was trained on the earliest 902 records in the dataset. The next 902 records formed a cross-validation file, which was used to optimize the training. A third file composed of the next 100 records facilitated the choice of a cutoff number between 0 and 1. The cutoff number was applied to the last 100 records, which comprised a test file. Results:: When a cutoff of 0.25 was compared to the network outputs of all 100 records in the test file, 12 of 46 (specificity=26%) patients without significant stenosis had outputs @?0.25, but all patients with significant stenosis had outputs >0.25 (sensitivity=100%). Therefore, the network identified a fraction of the patients in the test file who did not have significant coronary artery stenosis, while at the same time the network identified all of the patients in the test file who had significant stenosis capable of causing chest pain. Conclusion:: Artificial neural networks may be helpful in reducing unnecessary cardiac catheterizations.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Decision support of inspired oxygen selection based on Bayesian learning of pulmonary gas exchange parameters.	David Murley,Stephen E. Rees,Bodil Rasmussen,Steen Andreassen	2005	Objective:: To investigate if the real-time Bayesian learning of physiological model parameters can be used to support and improve the selection of inspired oxygen fraction. Methods and material:: Supporting the selection of inspired oxygen fraction relies on predictions of arterial oxygen saturation. The efficacy of using these predictions to select inspired oxygen was tested retrospectively in a system for estimating gas exchange parameters of the lung (Automatic Lung Parameter Estimator, ALPE). For the predictions to offer effective decision support they need to be accurate and above all safe. These qualities were tested with data from 16 post-operative cardiac patients, using two different tests. The aim of the first test was to assess retrospectively if the predictions could have supported clinical decisions. The second test sought to establish if the predictions could support improving the efficiency of inspired oxygen selection during an ALPE oxygen titration. Results:: The predictions were found to be reasonably accurate, and most importantly safe in both of the tests. Conclusion:: The method described can be used to support the selection of inspired oxygen fraction, and it has the potential to improve the efficiency of inspired oxygen selection during an oxygen titration.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Computational modeling of oligonucleotide positional densities for human promoter prediction.	Vipin Narang,Wing-Kin Sung,Ankush Mittal	2005	Objective:: The gene promoter region controls transcriptional initiation of a gene, which is the most important step in gene regulation. In-silico detection of promoter region in genomic sequences has a number of applications in gene discovery and understanding gene expression regulation. However, computational prediction of eukaryotic poly-II promoters has remained a difficult task. This paper introduces a novel statistical technique for detecting promoter regions in long genomic sequences. Method:: A number of existing techniques analyze the occurrence frequencies of oligonucleotides in promoter sequences as compared to other genomic regions. In contrast, the present work studies the positional densities of oligonucleotides in promoter sequences. The analysis does not require any non-promoter sequence dataset or any model of the background oligonucleotide content of the genome. The statistical model learnt from a dataset of promoter sequences automatically recognizes a number of transcription factor binding sites simultaneously with their occurrence positions relative to the transcription start site. Based on this model, a continuous naive Bayes classifier is developed for the detection of human promoters and transcription start sites in genomic sequences. Results:: The present study extends the scope of statistical models in general promoter modeling and prediction. Promoter sequence features learnt by the model correlate well with known biological facts. Results of human transcription start site prediction compare favorably with existing 2nd generation promoter prediction tools.

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Knowledge-assisted recognition of cluster boundaries in gene expression data.	Yoshifumi Okada,Takehiko Sahara,Hikaru Mitsubayashi,Satoru Ohgiya,Tomomasa Nagashima	2005	Background and motivation:: DNA microarray technology has made it possible to determine the expression levels of thousands of genes in parallel under multiple experimental conditions. Genome-wide analyses using DNA microarrays make a great contribution to the exploration of the dynamic state of genetic networks, and further lead to the development of new disease diagnosis technologies. An important step in the analysis of gene expression data is to classify genes with similar expression patterns into the same groups. To this end, hierarchical clustering algorithms have been widely used. Major advantages of hierarchical clustering algorithms are that investigators do not need to specify the number of clusters in advance and results are presented visually in the form of a dendrogram. However, since traditional hierarchical clustering methods simply provide results on the statistical characteristics of expression data, biological interpretations of the resulting clusters are not easy, and it requires laborious tasks to unveil hidden biological processes regulated by members in the clusters. Therefore, it has been a very difficult routine for experts. Objective:: Here, we propose a novel algorithm in which cluster boundaries are determined by referring to functional annotations stored in genome databases. Materials and methods:: The algorithm first performs hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles. Then, the cluster boundaries are determined by the Variance Inflation Factor among the Gene Function Vectors, which represents distributions of gene functions in each cluster. Our algorithm automatically specifies a cutoff that leads to functionally independent agglomerations of genes on the dendrogram derived from similarities among gene expression patterns. Finally, each cluster is annotated according to dominant gene functions within the respective cluster. Results and conclusions:: In this paper, we apply our algorithm to two gene expression datasets related to cell cycle and cold stress response in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. As a result, we show that the algorithm enables us to recognize cluster boundaries characterizing fundamental biological processes such as the Early G1, Late G1, S, G2 and M phases in cell cycles, and also provides novel annotation information that has not been obtained by traditional hierarchical clustering methods. In addition, using formal cluster validity indices, high validity of our algorithm is verified by the comparison through other popular clustering algorithms, K-means, self-organizing map and AutoClass. rganizing map (SOM) and AutoClass.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Characterization of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms using neural networks and support vector machines.	Athanasios Papadopoulos,Dimitrios I. Fotiadis,Aristidis Likas	2005	"Objective: : Detection and characterization of microcalcification clusters in mammograms is vital in daily clinical practice. The scope of this work is to present a novel computer-based automated method for the characterization of microcalcification clusters in digitized mammograms. Methods and material: : The proposed method has been implemented in three stages: (a) the cluster detection stage to identify clusters of microcalcifications, (b) the feature extraction stage to compute the important features of each cluster and (c) the classification stage, which provides with the final characterization. In the classification stage, a rule-based system, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) have been implemented and evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The proposed method was evaluated using the Nijmegen and Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) mammographic databases. The original feature set was enhanced by the addition of four rule-based features. Results and conclusions: : In the case of Nijmegen dataset, the performance of the SVM was A""z=0.79 and 0.77 for the original and enhanced feature set, respectively, while for the MIAS dataset the corresponding characterization scores were A""z=0.81 and 0.80. Utilizing neural network classification methodology, the corresponding performance for the Nijmegen dataset was A""z=0.70 and 0.76 while for the MIAS dataset it was A""z=0.73 and 0.78. Although the obtained high classification performance can be successfully applied to microcalcification clusters characterization, further studies must be carried out for the clinical evaluation of the system using larger datasets. The use of additional features originating either from the image itself (such as cluster location and orientation) or from the patient data may further improve the diagnostic value of the system."

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Identification of signatures in biomedical spectra using domain knowledge.	Erinija Pranckeviciene,Ray L. Somorjai,Richard Baumgartner,Moongu Jeon	2005	"Objective: Demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge into feature selection methods helps identify interpretable features with predictive capability comparable to a state-of-the-art classifier. Methods: Two feature selection methods, one using a genetic algorithm (GA) the other a L""1-norm support vector machine (SVM), were investigated on three real-world biomedical magnetic resonance (MR) spectral datasets of increasing difficulty. Consensus sets of the feature sets obtained by the two methods were also assessed. Results and conclusions: Features identified independently by the two methods and by their consensus, determine class-discriminatory groups or individual features, whose predictive power compares favorably with that of a state-of-the-art classifier. Furthermore, the identified feature signatures form stable groupings at definite spectral positions, hence are readily interpretable. This is a useful and important practical result for generating hypothesis for the domain expert. t."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Highly accurate and consistent method for prediction of helix and strand content from primary protein sequences.	Jishou Ruan,Kui Wang,Jie Yang,Lukasz A. Kurgan,Krzysztof J. Cios	2005	Objective:: One of interesting computational topics in bioinformatics is prediction of secondary structure of proteins. Over 30 years of research has been devoted to the topic but we are still far away from having reliable prediction methods. A critical piece of information for accurate prediction of secondary structure is the helix and strand content of a given protein sequence. Ability to accurately predict content of those two secondary structures has a good potential to improve accuracy of prediction of the secondary structure. Most of the existing methods use composition vector to predict the content. Their underlying assumption is that the vector can be used to provide functional mapping between primary sequence and helix/strand content. While this is true for small sets of proteins we show that for larger protein sets such mapping are inconsistent, i.e. the same composition vectors correspond to different contents. To this end, we propose a method for prediction of helix/strand content from primary protein sequences that is fundamentally different from currently available methods. Methods and material:: Our method is accurate and uses a novel approach to obtain information from primary sequence based on a composition moment vector, which is a measure that includes information about both composition of a given primary sequence and the position of amino acids in the sequence. In contrast to the composition vector, we show that it provides functional mapping between primary sequence and the helix/strand content. Results:: A set of benchmarks involving a large protein dataset consisting of over 11,000 protein sequences from Protein Data Bank was performed to validate the method. Prediction done by a neural network had average accuracy of 91.5% for the helix and 94.5% for the strand contents. We also show that using the new measure results in about 40% reduction of error rates when compared with the composition vector results. Conclusions:: The developed method has much better accuracy when compared with other existing methods, as shown on a large body of proteins, in contrast to other reported results that often target small sets of specific protein types, such as globular proteins.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Part-whole representation and reasoning in formal biomedical ontologies.	Stefan Schulz,Udo Hahn	2005	Objective:Biomedical ontologies are typically structured in a biaxial way, reflecting both a taxonomic (is-a) and a partonomic (part-of) hierarchy. Commonly used biomedical terminologies, which incorporate such distinctions excel in terms of broad coverage but lack a rigid formal foundation. The latter, however, is a prerequisite for automated reasoning. For the biomedical domain, it is not only crucial to cope with ontological dependencies between wholes and their parts but also with specific reasoning patterns which underlie the propagation of roles across partonomic hierarchies. Methods: We scale down part-whole reasoning to subsumption-based taxonomic reasoning within the formal framework of a parsimonious variant of description logics (viz. ALC). Results: We provide a formal basis for ontological engineering in the domain of biomedicine, as far as part-whole relationships are concerned, by addressing typical reasoning patterns encountered in this domain. countered in this domain.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Generalised reliability characteristics for probabilistic networks.	Danielle Sent,Linda C. van der Gaag	2005	"Background:: In the medical domain, establishing a diagnosis typically amounts to reasoning about the unobservable truth, based upon a set of indirect observations from diagnostic tests. A diagnostic test may not be perfectly reliable, however. To avoid misdiagnosis, therefore, the reliability characteristics of the test should be taken into account upon reasoning. Objective:: In this paper, we address the issue of modelling the reliability characteristics of diagnostic tests in a probabilistic network. Method:: To this end, we study the mathematical foundation of a test's characteristics and collate them with the probabilities required for a probabilistic network. Results:: We show that the standard reliability characteristics that are generally available from the literature have to be further detailed and stratified, for example by experts, before they can be included in a network. We demonstrate these modelling issues by means of a real-life probabilistic network in oncology."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	A landmark extraction method for protein 2DE gel images based on multi-dimensional clustering.	Jung Eun Shim,Won Suk Lee	2005	Objective:: Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) is a separation technique that can identify target proteins existing in a tissue. Its result is represented by a gel image that displays an individual protein in a tissue as a spot. However, because the technique suffers from low reproducibility, a user should manually annotate landmark spots on each gel image to analyze the spots of different images together. This operation is an error-prone and tedious job. For this reason, this paper proposes a method of extracting landmark spots automatically by using a data mining technique. Method and material:: A landmark profile which summarizes the characteristics of landmark spots in a set of training gel images of the same tissue is generated by extracting the common properties of the landmark spots. On the basis of the landmark profile, candidate landmark spots in a new gel image of the same tissue are identified, and final landmark spots are determined by the well-known A^* search algorithm. Result and conclusions:: The performance of the proposed method is analyzed through a series of experiments in order to identify its various characteristics.

Davis Parker Jr.	2005	"Objective: Mitochondrial genetics has unique features that impede analysis of the biological significance of mitochondrial mutations. Simple searches for differences in total mutational load between normal and pathological samples have been frequently unrewarding, raising the possibility that more complex patterns of mutations may be responsible for some conditions. We explore this possibility in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods and materials: We report the development of a modified genetic algorithm suited for detection of biologically meaningful patterns of mitochondrial mutations. The algorithm is applied to a database of mutations derived from biological samples, and verified by the use of shuffled data, and repeated leave-one-out testing. Results: It is possible to derive, from a very small sample, multiple accurate classifier functions that correlate with biological features. The methodology is validated statistically through experiments with fabricated data. Conclusion: This algorithm might be generally applicable to conditions where interactions among multiple mitochondrial DNA mutations are important. The patterns embodied in the classifier functions obtained should be the subject of further experimental study. dy."

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	A model of motor control of the nematode with neuronal circuits.	Michiyo Suzuki,Toshio Tsuji,Hisao Ohtake	2005	Objective:: Living organisms have mechanisms to adapt to various conditions of external environments. If we can realize these mechanisms on the computer, it may be possible to apply methods of biological and biomimetic adaptation to the engineering of artificial machines. This paper focuses on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), which has a relatively simple structure and is one of the most studied multicellular organisms. We aim to develop its computer model, artificial C. elegans, to analyze control mechanisms with respect to motion. Although C. elegans processes many kinds of external stimuli, we focused on gentle touch stimulation. Methods:: The proposed model consists of a neuronal circuit model for motor control that responds to gentle touch stimuli and a kinematic model of the body for movement. All parameters included in the neuronal circuit model are adjusted by using the real-coded genetic algorithm. Also, the neuronal oscillator model is employed in the body model to generate the sinusoidal movement. The motion velocity of the body model is controlled by the neuronal circuit model so as to correspond to the touch stimuli that are received in sensory neurons. Conclusion:: The computer simulations confirmed that the proposed model is capable of realizing motor control similar to that of the actual organism qualitatively. By using the artificial organism it may be possible to clarify or predict some characteristics that cannot be measured in actual experiments. With the recent development of computer technology, such a computational analysis becomes a real possibility. The artificial C. elegans will contribute for studies in experimental biology in future, although it is still developing at present.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Bio-medical entity extraction using support vector machines.	Koichi Takeuchi,Nigel Collier	2005	Objective:: Support vector machines (SVMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in several classification tasks. In this article we apply them to the identification and semantic annotation of scientific and technical terminology in the domain of molecular biology. This illustrates the extensibility of the traditional named entity task to special domains with large-scale terminologies such as those in medicine and related disciplines. Methods and materials:: The foundation for the model is a sample of text annotated by a domain expert according to an ontology of concepts, properties and relations. The model then learns to annotate unseen terms in new texts and contexts. The results can be used for a variety of intelligent language processing applications. We illustrate SVMs capabilities using a sample of 100 journal abstracts texts taken from the {human, blood cell, transcription factor} domain of MEDLINE. Results:: Approximately 3400 terms are annotated and the model performs at about 74% F-score on cross-validation tests. A detailed analysis based on empirical evidence shows the contribution of various feature sets to performance. Conclusion:: Our experiments indicate a relationship between feature window size and the amount of training data and that a combination of surface words, orthographic features and head noun features achieve the best performance among the feature sets tested.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Granular support vector machines with association rules mining for protein homology prediction.	Yuchun Tang,Bo Jin,Yan-Qing Zhang	2005	"Objective:: Protein homology prediction between protein sequences is one of critical problems in computational biology. Such a complex classification problem is common in medical or biological information processing applications. How to build a model with superior generalization capability from training samples is an essential issue for mining knowledge to accurately predict/classify unseen new samples and to effectively support human experts to make correct decisions. Methodology:: A new learning model called granular support vector machines (GSVM) is proposed based on our previous work. GSVM systematically and formally combines the principles from statistical learning theory and granular computing theory and thus provides an interesting new mechanism to address complex classification problems. It works by building a sequence of information granules and then building support vector machines (SVM) in some of these information granules on demand. A good granulation method to find suitable granules is crucial for modeling a GSVM with good performance. In this paper, we also propose an association rules-based granulation method. For the granules induced by association rules with high enough confidence and significant support, we leave them as they are because of their high ''purity'' and significant effect on simplifying the classification task. For every other granule, a SVM is modeled to discriminate the corresponding data. In this way, a complex classification problem is divided into multiple smaller problems so that the learning task is simplified. Results and conclusions:: The proposed algorithm, here named GSVM-AR, is compared with SVM by KDDCUP04 protein homology prediction data. The experimental results show that finding the splitting hyperplane is not a trivial task (we should be careful to select the association rules to avoid overfitting) and GSVM-AR does show significant improvement compared to building one single SVM in the whole feature space. Another advantage is that the utility of GSVM-AR is very good because it is easy to be implemented. More importantly and more interestingly, GSVM provides a new mechanism to address complex classification problems."

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	A spatio-temporal Bayesian network classifier for understanding visual field deterioration.	Allan Tucker,Veronica Vinciotti,Xiaohui Liu,David Garway-Heath	2005	"Objective: Progressive loss of the field of vision is characteristic of a number of eye diseases such as glaucoma which is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Recently, there has been an explosion in the amount of data being stored on patients who suffer from visual deterioration including field test data, retinal image data and patient demographic data. However, there has been relatively little work in modelling the spatial and temporal relationships common to such data. In this paper we introduce a novel method for classifying visual field (VF) data that explicitly models these spatial and temporal relationships. Methodology: We carry out an analysis of our proposed spatio-temporal Bayesian classifier and compare it to a number of classifiers from the machine learning and statistical communities. These are all tested on two datasets of VF and clinical data. We investigate the receiver operating characteristics curves, the resulting network structures and also make use of existing anatomical knowledge of the eye in order to validate the discovered models. Results: Results are very encouraging showing that our classifiers are comparable to existing statistical models whilst also facilitating the understanding of underlying spatial and temporal relationships within VF data. The results reveal the potential of using such models for knowledge discovery within ophthalmic databases, such as networks reflecting the 'nasal step', an early indicator of the onset of glaucoma. Conclusion: The results outlined in this paper pave the way for a substantial program of study involving many other spatial and temporal datasets, including retinal image and clinical data."

Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Factors affecting automated syndromic surveillance.	Ling Wang,Marco Ramoni,Kenneth D. Mandl,Paola Sebastiani	2005	Objective:: The increased threat of bioterroristic attacks and epidemic events requires the development of accurate and timely outbreak detection systems for early identification of anomalies in public health data. Material and methods:: We propose an automated outbreak detection system based on syndromic data. This system uses an autoregressive model with seasonal components to monitor, online, the daily counts of chief complaints for respiratory syndromes at the emergency department of two major metropolitan hospitals. We evaluate this system by estimating the false positive rate in real data under the assumption that there were no outbreaks of disease, and the true positive rate in real baseline data in which we injected stochastically simulated outbreaks of different shape and size. We then use directed graphical models to account for the effect of exogenous factors on the detection performance of the system. Results:: Our study shows that for a week-long outbreak, our model has an overall 84.8% true detection accuracy across all shapes of outbreaks, while the outbreak size influences the earliness to detection. The false and true positive rates are also associated with the exogenous factors and knowledge about these factors can help to improve the detection accuracy. Conclusion:: This study suggests that the integration of multiple data sources can significantly improve the detection accuracy of syndromic surveillance systems.
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	An expert study evaluating the UMLS lexical metaschema.	Li Zhang,George Hripcsak,Yehoshua Perl,Michael Halper,James Geller	2005	"Objective:: A metaschema is an abstraction network of the UMLS's semantic network (SN) obtained from a connected partition of its collection of semantic types. A lexical metaschema was previously derived based on a lexical partition which partitioned the SN into semantic-type groups using identical word-usage among the names of semantic types and the definitions of their respective children. In this paper, a statistical analysis methodology is presented to evaluate the lexical metaschema based on a study involving a group of established UMLS experts. Methods:: In the study, each expert was asked to identify subject areas of the SN based on his or her understanding of the various semantic types. For this purpose, the expert scans the SN hierarchy top-down, identifying semantic types, which are important and different enough from their parent semantic types, as roots of their groups. From the response of each expert, an ''expert metaschema'' is constructed. The different experts' metaschemas can vary widely. So, additional metaschemas are obtained from aggregations of the experts' responses. Of special interest is the consensus metaschema which represents an aggregation of a simple majority of the experts' responses. Statistical analysis comparing the lexical metaschema with the experts' metaschemas and the consensus metaschema is presented. Results:: The analysis results shows that 17 out of the 21 meta-semantic types in the lexical metaschema also appear in the consensus metaschema (about 81%). There are 107 semantic types (about 79%) covered by identical meta-semantic types and refinements. The results show the high similarity between the two metaschemas. Furthermore, the statistical analysis shows that the lexical metaschema did not grossly underperform compared to the experts. Conclusion:: Our study shows that the lexical metaschema provides a good approximation for a partition of meaningful subject areas in the SN, when compared to the consensus metaschema capturing the aggregation of a simple majority of the human experts' opinions."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	A lexical metaschema for the UMLS semantic network.	Li Zhang,Yehoshua Perl,Michael Halper,James Geller,George Hripcsak	2005	"Objective: A metaschema is a high-level abstraction network of the UMLS's semantic network (SN) obtained from a partition of the SN's collection of semantic types. Every metaschema has nodes, called meta-semantic types, each of which denotes a group of semantic types constituting a subject area of the SN. A new kind of metaschema, called the lexical metaschema, is derived from a lexical partition of the SN. The lexical metaschema is compared to previously derived metaschemas, e.g., the cohesive metaschema.Design: A new lexical partitioning methodology is presented based on identical word-usage among the names of semantic types and the definitions of their respective children. The lexical metaschema is derived from the application of the methodology. We compare the constituent meta-semantic types and their underlying semantic-type groups with the previously derived cohesive metaschema. A similar comparison of the lexical partition and a published partition of the SN is also carried out.Results: The lexical partition of the SN has 21 semantic-type groups, each of which represents a subject area. The lexical metaschema thus has 21 meta-semantic types, 19 meta-child-of hierarchical relationships, and 86 meta-relationships. Our comparison shows that 15 out of the 21 meta-semantic types in the lexical metaschema also appear in the cohesive metaschema, and 80 semantic types are covered by identical meta-semantic types or refinements between the two metaschemas. The comparison between the lexical partition and the semantic partition shows that they have very low similarity.Conclusion: The algorithmically derived lexical metaschema serves as an abstraction of the SN and provides views representing different subject areas. It compares favorably with the cohesive metaschema derived via the SN's relationship configuration."
Artificial Intelligence in Medicine	Efficient RNAi-based gene family knockdown via set cover optimization.	Wenzhong Zhao,M. Leigh Fanning,Terran Lane	2005	"Objective:: We address the problem of selecting an efficient set of initiator molecules (siRNAs) for RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene family knockdown experiments. Our goal is to select a minimal set of siRNAs that (a) cover a targeted gene family or a specified subset of it, (b) do not cover any untargeted genes, and (c) are individually highly effective at inducing knockdown. Methods and material:: We give two formalizations of the gene family knockdown problem. First, we show that the problem, minimizing the number of siRNAs required to knock down a family of genes, is NP-Hard via a reduction to the set cover problem. Second, we generalize the basic problem to incorporate additional biological constraints and optimality criteria. To solve the resulting set-cover variants, we modify the classical branch-and-bound algorithm to include some of these biological criteria. We find that in many typical cases these constraints reduce the search space enough that we are able to compute exact minimal siRNA covers within reasonable time. For larger cases, we propose a probabilistic greedy algorithm for finding minimal siRNA covers efficiently. We apply our methods to two different gene families, the FREP genes from Biomphalaria glabrata and the olfactory genes from Caenorhabditis elegans. Results and conclusion:: Our computational results on real biological data show that the probabilistic greedy algorithm produces siRNA covers as good as the branch-and-bound algorithm in most cases. Both algorithms return minimal siRNA covers with high predicted probability that the selected siRNAs will be effective at inducing knockdown. We also examine the role of ''off-target'' interactions: the constraint of avoiding covering untargeted genes can, in some cases, substantially increase the complexity of the resulting solution. Overall, we find that in many common cases our approach significantly reduces the number of siRNAs required in gene family knockdown experiments, as compared to knocking down genes independently."

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	GMDH-based feature ranking and selection for improved classification of medical data.	R. E. Abdel-Aal	2005	Medical applications are often characterized by a large number of disease markers and a relatively small number of data records. We demonstrate that complete feature ranking followed by selection can lead to appreciable reductions in data dimensionality, with significant improvements in the implementation and performance of classifiers for medical diagnosis. We describe a novel approach for ranking all features according to their predictive quality using properties unique to learning algorithms based on the group method of data handling (GMDH). An abductive network training algorithm is repeatedly used to select groups of optimum predictors from the feature set at gradually increasing levels of model complexity specified by the user. Groups selected earlier are better predictors. The process is then repeated to rank features within individual groups. The resulting full feature ranking can be used to determine the optimum feature subset by starting at the top of the list and progressively including more features until the classification error rate on an out-of-sample evaluation set starts to increase due to overfitting. The approach is demonstrated on two medical diagnosis datasets (breast cancer and heart disease) and comparisons are made with other feature ranking and selection methods. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis is used to compare classifier performance. At default model complexity, dimensionality reduction of 22 and 54% could be achieved for the breast cancer and heart disease data, respectively, leading to improvements in the overall classification performance. For both datasets, considerable dimensionality reduction introduced no significant reduction in the area under the ROC curve. GMDH-based feature selection results have also proved effective with neural network classifiers.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Telephone-linked care for physical activity: A qualitative evaluation of the use patterns of an information technology program for patients.	Ramesh Farzanfar,Sophie Frishkopf,Jeffrey P. Migneault,Robert H. Friedman	2005	"Automated health behavior interventions that involve discretionary use by patients or consumers over extended periods of time are becoming more common and it is generally assumed that adherence to the recommended schedule is related to the impact of the system on users. Yet reasons for use or non-use of such systems have not been carefully explored. An understanding of factors that influence people to use, not use, or underutilize these automated behavioral change and self-care management systems can help in designing systems that are more effective and acceptable to users. Using qualitative research methods, this study explored the experiences of 45 users of a multiple-contact health promotion application with the goal of understanding the major factors that affect patterns of use (frequency of and duration of contact). The in-depth exploration of users' perceptions and views made possible by the qualitative research methods revealed a number of important themes. Reported reasons for underutilization or non-use were found to be both user-related and system-related. User-related reasons encompassed personal and individual events that prevented or impeded system utilization. System-related reasons included those that related to the medium itself as well as the content of the application. The qualitative methods employed in this study created a forum through which users' feedback could be fully explored and then synthesized to assist in the improvement of this and other automated health behavior interventions."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Identifying reasoning strategies in medical decision making: A methodological guide.	José F. Arocha,Dongwen Wang,Vimla L. Patel	2005	Reasoning strategies are a key component in many medical tasks, including decision making, clinical problem solving, and understanding of medical texts. Identification of reasoning strategies used by clinicians may prove critical to the optimal design of decision support systems. This paper presents a formal method of cognitive-semantic analysis for the identification and characterization of reasoning strategies deployed in medical tasks and demonstrates its use through specific examples. Although semantic analysis was originally developed in the investigation of knowledge structures, it can also be applied to identify the reasoning and decision processes used by physicians and medical trainees in clinical tasks. Assumptions underlying the methods, as well as illustrations of their use in diagnostic explanation tasks, are presented. We discuss semantic analysis in the context of the current interests in developing medical ontologies and argue that a frame-based propositional analytic methodology can provide a systematic way of addressing the construction of such ontologies. Although the application of propositional analysis methods has some limitations, we show how such limitations are being addressed and present some examples of information tools that have been developed to ease, and make more systematic, the process of analysis.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A user-centered framework for redesigning health care interfaces.	Constance M. Johnson,Todd R. Johnson,Jiajie Zhang	2005	Numerous health care systems are designed without consideration of user-centered design guidelines. Consequently, systems are created ad hoc, users are dissatisfied and often systems are abandoned. This is not only a waste of human resources, but economic resources as well. In order to salvage such systems, we have combined different methods from the area of computer science, cognitive science, psychology, and human-computer interaction to formulate a framework for guiding the redesign process. The paper provides a review of the different methods involved in this process and presents a life cycle of our redesign approach. Following the description of the methods, we present a case study, which shows a successfully applied example of the use of this framework. A comparison between the original and redesigned interfaces showed improvements in system usefulness, information quality, and interface quality.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Modelling of classification rules on metabolic patterns including machine learning and expert knowledge.	Christian Baumgartner,Christian Böhm,Daniela Baumgartner	2005	"Machine learning has a great potential to mine potential markers from high-dimensional metabolic data without any a priori knowledge. Exemplarily, we investigated metabolic patterns of three severe metabolic disorders, PAHD, MCADD, and 3-MCCD, on which we constructed classification models for disease screening and diagnosis using a decision tree paradigm and logistic regression analysis (LRA). For the LRA model-building process we assessed the relevance of established diagnostic flags, which have been developed from the biochemical knowledge of newborn metabolism, and compared the models' error rates with those of the decision tree classifier. Both approaches yielded comparable classification accuracy in terms of sensitivity (<95.2%), while the LRA models built on flags showed significantly enhanced specificity. The number of false positive cases did not exceed 0.001%."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Feature selection in Bayesian classifiers for the prognosis of survival of cirrhotic patients treated with TIPS.	Rosa Blanco,Iñaki Inza,Marisa Merino,Jorge Quiroga,Pedro Larrañaga	2005	The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a treatment for cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension. A subgroup of patients dies in the first 6 months and another subgroup lives a long period of time. Nowadays, no risk factors have been identified in order to determine how long a patient will survive. An empirical study for predicting the survival rate within the first 6 months after TIPS placement is conducted using a clinical database with 107 cases and 77 variables. Applications of Bayesian classification models, based on Bayesian networks, to medical problems have become popular in the last years. Feature subset selection is useful due to the heterogeneity of the medical databases where not all the variables are required to perform the classification. In this paper, filter and wrapper approaches based on the feature subset selection are adapted to induce Bayesian classifiers (naive Bayes, selective naive Bayes, semi naive Bayes, tree augmented naive Bayes, and k-dependence Bayesian classifier) and are applied to distinguish between the two subgroups of cirrhotic patients. The estimated accuracies obtained tally with the results of previous studies. Moreover, the medical significance of the subset of variables selected by the classifiers along with the comprehensibility of Bayesian models is greatly appreciated by physicians.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	"Toward a framework for understanding lay public's comprehension of disaster and bioterrorism information."	Alla Keselman,Laura Slaughter,Vimla L. Patel	2005	"In the last decade, we have witnessed a significant increase in disaster preparedness and crisis communication efforts. This stands in sharp contrast with paucity of research that deals with the public's comprehension of disaster information and related decision-making. The objective of this paper is to outline a theoretical and methodological framework for research on lay comprehension of crisis information. The proposed framework integrates two bodies of research: (1) cognitive science literature on comprehension and decision-making and (2) studies of the effects of anxiety on performance. The paper reviews selected works and methods from both fields, discussing how cognitive perspective could be extended to include emotional factors. We also discuss how further research integrating the proposed framework with public health communication perspective could: (1) provide insights for developing effective disaster communication and (2) inform the development of technological support for disaster communication and for education of lay people and health professionals."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Algorithms for rapid outbreak detection: a research synthesis.	David L. Buckeridge,Howard Burkom,Murray Campbell,William R. Hogan,Andrew W. Moore	2005	The threat of bioterrorism has stimulated interest in enhancing public health surveillance to detect disease outbreaks more rapidly than is currently possible. To advance research on improving the timeliness of outbreak detection, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency sponsored the Bio-event Advanced Leading Indicator Recognition Technology (BioALIRT) project beginning in 2001. The purpose of this paper is to provide a synthesis of research on outbreak detection algorithms conducted by academic and industrial partners in the BioALIRT project. We first suggest a practical classification for outbreak detection algorithms that considers the types of information encountered in surveillance analysis. We then present a synthesis of our research according to this classification. The research conducted for this project has examined how to use spatial and other covariate information from disparate sources to improve the timeliness of outbreak detection. Our results suggest that use of spatial and other covariate information can improve outbreak detection performance. We also identified, however, methodological challenges that limited our ability to determine the benefit of using outbreak detection algorithms that operate on large volumes of data. Future research must address challenges such as forecasting expected values in high-dimensional data and generating spatial and multivariate test data sets. Published by Elsevier Inc.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Modeling a description logic vocabulary for cancer research.	Frank W. Hartel,Sherri de Coronado,Robert Dionne,Gilberto Fragoso,Jennifer Golbeck	2005	The National Cancer Institute has developed the NCI Thesaurus, a biomedical vocabulary for cancer research, covering terminology across a wide range of cancer research domains. A major design goal of the NCI Thesaurus is to facilitate translational research. We describe: the features of Ontylog, a description logic used to build NCI Thesaurus; our methodology for enhancing the terminology through collaboration between ontologists and domain experts, and for addressing certain real world challenges arising in modeling the Thesaurus; and finally, we describe the conversion of NCI Thesaurus from Ontylog into Web Ontology Language Lite. Ontylog has proven well suited for constructing big biomedical vocabularies. We have capitalized on the Ontylog constructs Kind and Role in the collaboration process described in this paper to facilitate communication between ontologists and domain experts. The artifacts and processes developed by NCI for collaboration may be useful in other biomedical terminology development efforts.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The use of receiver operating characteristic curves in biomedical informatics.	Thomas A. Lasko,Jui G. Bhagwat,Kelly H. Zou,Lucila Ohno-Machado	2005	"Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are frequently used in biomedical informatics research to evaluate classification and prediction models for decision support, diagnosis, and prognosis. ROC analysis investigates the accuracy of a model's ability to separate positive from negative cases (such as predicting the presence or absence of disease), and the results are independent of the prevalence of positive cases in the study population. It is especially useful in evaluating predictive models or other tests that produce output values over a continuous range, since it captures the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity over that range. There are many ways to conduct an ROC analysis. The best approach depends on the experiment; an inappropriate approach can easily lead to incorrect conclusions. In this article, we review the basic concepts of ROC analysis, illustrate their use with sample calculations, make recommendations drawn from the literature, and list readily available software."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Decisions about critical events in device-related scenarios as a function of expertise.	Archana Laxmisan,Sameer Malhotra,Alla Keselman,Todd R. Johnson,Vimla L. Patel	2005	"This paper presents the perspectives of personnel involved in decision-making about devices in critical care. We use the concept of ""sharp and blunt ends"" of practice to describe the performance of health care professionals. The ""sharp end"" is physically and temporally close to the system; the ""blunt end"" is removed from the system in time and space and yet affects the system through indirect influence on the sharp end. In this study, the sharp end is represented by the clinicians (nurses and doctors) and the blunt end by the administrators and biomedical engineers. These subjects represent the professionals involved in the decision-making process for purchasing biomedical equipment for the hospital. They were asked to ""think aloud"" while evaluating three error scenarios based on real events. The responses were recorded and transcribed for analysis. The results show differences in interpretation of critical events as a function of professional expertise. The clinicians (sharp-end practitioners) focused on clinical and human aspect of errors while the biomedical engineers focused on device-related errors. The administrators focused on documentation and training. These different interpretations mean that the problems are represented differently by these groups of subjects, and these representations result in variable decisions about devices. These results are discussed within a systems approach framework to help us assess the completeness of the problem representations of the subjects, their awareness of critical events, and how these events would collectively contribute to the occurrence of error."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A framework for modeling health behavior protocols and their linkage to behavioral theory.	Leslie Lenert,Gregory J. Norman,Mark Mailhot,Kevin Patrick	2005	With the rise in chronic, behavior-related disease, computerized behavioral protocols (CBPs) that help individuals improve behaviors have the potential to play an increasing role in the future health of society. To be effective and widely used CBPs should be based on accepted behavioral theory. However, designing CBPs while at the same time specifying their linkages to behavioral theory and developing reusable CBP components (interventions) are challenges to developers of CBPs. Having an ontology with which to describe CBPs could help with these issues. As a first step towards creating such an ontology, we modeled PACE-Adolescent, a theory-based behavioral protocol that uses the Stages of Change Model and Social Cognitive Theory, using PROTÉGÉ-2000, an ontology editor and knowledge acquisition system. We created a three-part knowledge model. Two sub-ontologies described behavioral interventions and psychological theories. The third component, implemented using Guideline Interchange Format (GLIF3), provided a way to describe the structure of a protocol and to link intervention resources and groups of actions to elements of psychological theory. Using this framework, we formally described the PACE-Adolescent protocol. Creating knowledge models such as this may lead to improvements in the design and evaluation of computerized health behavior protocols.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Domain-specific language models and lexicons for tagging.	Anni Coden,Sergey V. Pakhomov,Rie Kubota Ando,Patrick H. Duffy,Christopher G. Chute	2005	Accurate and reliable part-of-speech tagging is useful for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks that form the foundation of NLP-based approaches to information retrieval and data mining. In general, large annotated corpora are necessary to achieve desired part-of-speech tagger accuracy. We show that a large annotated general-English corpus is not sufficient for building a part-of-speech tagger model adequate for tagging documents from the medical domain. However, adding a quite small domain-specific corpus to a large general-English one boosts performance to over 92% accuracy from 87% in our studies. We also suggest a number of characteristics to quantify the similarities between a training corpus and the test data. These results give guidance for creating an appropriate corpus for building a part-of-speech tagger model that gives satisfactory accuracy results on a new domain at a relatively small cost.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Evaluating user interactions with clinical information systems: A model based on human-computer interaction models.	Christelle Despont-Gros,Henning Müller,Christian Lovis	2005	Objectives: This article proposes a model for dimensions involved in user evaluation of clinical information systems (CIS). The model links the dimensions in traditional CIS evaluation and the dimensions from the human-computer interaction (HCI) perspective.Proposed method: In this article, variables are defined as the properties measured in an evaluation, and dimensions are defined as the factors contributing to the values of the measured variables. The proposed model is based on a two-step methodology with: (1) a general review of information systems (IS) evaluations to highlight studied variables, existing models and frameworks, and (2) a review of HCI literature to provide the theoretical basis to key dimensions of user evaluation.Results: The review of literature led to the identification of eight key variables, among which satisfaction, acceptance, and success were found to be the most referenced.Discussion: Among those variables, IS acceptance is a relevant candidate to reflect user evaluation of CIS. While their goals are similar, the fields of traditional CIS evaluation, and HCI are not closely connected. Combining those two fields allows for the development of an integrated model which provides a model for summative and comprehensive user evaluation of CIS. All dimensions identified in existing studies can be linked to this model and such an integrated model could provide a new perspective to compare investigations of different CIS systems.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Nomographic representation of logistic regression models: A case study using patient self-assessment data.	Stephan Dreiseitl,Alexandra Harbauer,Michael Binder,Harald Kittler	2005	Logistic regression models are widely used in medicine, but difficult to apply without the aid of electronic devices. In this paper, we present a novel approach to represent logistic regression models as nomograms that can be evaluated by simple line drawings. As a case study, we show how data obtained from a questionnaire-based patient self-assessment study on the risks of developing melanoma can be used to first identify a subset of significant covariates, build a logistic regression model, and finally transform the model to a graphical format. The advantage of the nomogram is that it can easily be mass-produced, distributed and evaluated, while providing the same information as the logistic regression model it represents.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Designing the design phase of critical care devices: a cognitive approach.	Sameer Malhotra,Archana Laxmisan,Alla Keselman,Jiajie Zhang,Vimla L. Patel	2005	"In this study, we show how medical devices used for patient care can be made safer if various cognitive factors involved in patient management are taken into consideration during the design phase. The objective of this paper is to describe a methodology for obtaining insights into patient safety features--derived from investigations of institutional decision making--that could be incorporated into medical devices by their designers. The design cycle of a product, be it a medical device, software, or any kind of equipment, is similar in concept, and course. Through a series of steps we obtained information related to medical errors and patient safety. These were then utilized to customize the generic device design cycle in ways that would improve the production of critical care devices. First, we provided individuals with different levels of expertise in the clinical, administrative, and engineering domains of a large hospital setting with hypothetical clinical scenarios, each of which described a medical error event involving health professionals and medical devices. Then, we asked our subjects to ""think-aloud"" as they read through each scenario. Using a set of questions as probes, we then asked our subjects to identify key errors and attribute them to various players. We recorded and transcribed the responses and conducted a cognitive task analysis of each scenario to identify different entities as ""constant,"" ""partially modifiable,"" or ""modifiable."" We compared our subjects' responses to the results of the task analysis and then mapped them to the modifiable entities. Lastly, we coded the relationships of these entities to the errors in medical devices. We propose that the incorporation of these modifiable entities into the device design cycle could improve the device end product for better patient safety management."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Discrimination and calibration of mortality risk prediction models in interventional cardiology.	Michael E. Matheny,Lucila Ohno-Machado,Frederic S. Resnic	2005	"Objectives. Using a local percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) data repository, we sought to compare the performance of a number of local and well-known mortality models with respect to discrimination and calibration.Background. Accurate risk prediction is important for a number of reasons including physician decision support, quality of care assessment, and patient education. Current evidence on the value of applying PCI risk models to individual cases drawn from a different population is controversial.Methods. Data were collected from January 01, 2002 to September 30, 2004 on 5216 consecutive percutaneous coronary interventions at Brigham and Women's Hospital (Boston, MA). Logistic regression was used to create a local risk model for in-hospital mortality in these procedures, and a number of statistical methods were used to compare the discrimination and calibration of this new and old local risk models, as well as the Northern New England Cooperative Group, New York State (1992 and 1997), University of Michigan consortium, American College of Cardiology-National Cardiovascular Data Registry, and The Cleveland Clinic Foundation risk prediction models. Areas under the ROC (AUC) curves were used to evaluate discrimination, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test and calibration curves assessed applicability of the models to individual cases.Results. Multivariate risk factors included in the newly constructed local model were: age, prior intervention, diabetes, unstable angina, salvage versus elective procedure, cardiogenic shock, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and left anterior descending artery intervention. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.929 (SE = 0.017), and the p value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit was 0.473. This indicates good discrimination and calibration. Bootstrap re-sampling indicated AUC stability. Evaluation of the external models showed an AUC range from 0.82 to 0.90 indicating good discrimination across all models, but poor calibration (HL p value ≤ 0.0001).Conclusions. Validation of AUC values across all models suggests that certain risk factors have remained important over the last decade. However, the lack of calibration suggests that small changes in patient populations and data collection methods quickly reduce the accuracy of patient level estimations over time. Possible solutions to this problem involve either recalibration of models using local data or development of new local models."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Human factors engineering: A tool for medical device evaluation in hospital procurement decision-making.	Gill Ginsburg	2005	A human factors evaluation was conducted to inform hospital procurement decision-making in selecting a general-purpose infusion pump to be used hospital-wide. Three infusion pumps from different vendors were involved in the evaluation, which consisted of two phases: a human factors heuristic assessment of the pumps according to several criteria, and user testing in five clinical areas. The clinical areas were: Oncology, Medical/Surgical, Pediatric, ICU, and Anaesthesiology. Fourteen nurses and three anaesthetists participated in the user testing. Reasonable agreement was observed between results of both phases of the evaluation, and overall results clearly favoured one of the infusion pumps over the others. It is recommended that a human factors evaluation should be performed to influence all hospital procurement decisions when purchasing medical devices, to ensure the best devices are selected for the end users and to ultimately enhance patient safety.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Extracting information on pneumonia in infants using natural language processing of radiology reports.	Eneida A. Mendonça,Janet Haas,Lyudmila Shagina,Elaine Larson,Carol Friedman	2005	"Natural language processing (NLP) is critical for improvement of the healthcare process because it has the potential to encode the vast amount of clinical data in textual patient reports. Many clinical applications require coded data to function appropriately, such as decision support and quality assurance applications. However, in order to be applicable in the clinical domain, performance of the NLP systems must be adequate. A valuable clinical application is the detection of infectious diseases, such as surveillance of healthcare-associated pneumonia in newborns (e.g. neonates) because it produces significant rates of morbidity and mortality, and manual surveillance of respiratory infection in these patients is a challenge. Studies have already demonstrated that automated surveillance using NLP tools is a useful adjunct to manual clinical management, and is an effective tool for infection control practitioners. This paper presents a study aimed at evaluating the feasibility of an NLP-based electronic clinical monitoring system to identify healthcare-associated pneumonia in neonates. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value by comparing the detection with clinicians' judgments and our results demonstrated that the automated method was indeed feasible. Sensitivity (recall) was 87.5%, and specificity (true negative rates) was 94.1%."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A Bayesian network coding scheme for annotating biomedical information presented to genetic counseling clients.	Nancy Green	2005	We developed a Bayesian network coding scheme for annotating biomedical content in layperson-oriented clinical genetics documents. The coding scheme supports the representation of probabilistic and causal relationships among concepts in this domain, at a high enough level of abstraction to capture commonalities among genetic processes and their relationship to health. We are using the coding scheme to annotate a corpus of genetic counseling patient letters as part of the requirements analysis and knowledge acquisition phase of a natural language generation project. This paper describes the coding scheme and presents an evaluation of intercoder reliability for its tag set. In addition to giving examples of use of the coding scheme for analysis of discourse and linguistic features in this genre, we suggest other uses for it in analysis of layperson-oriented text and dialogue in medical communication.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	The anatomy of decision support during inpatient care provider order entry (CPOE): Empirical observations from a decade of CPOE experience at Vanderbilt.	Randolph A. Miller,Lemuel R. Waitman,Sutin Chen,S. Trent Rosenbloom	2005	"The authors describe a pragmatic approach to the introduction of clinical decision support at the point of care, based on a decade of experience in developing and evolving Vanderbilt's inpatient ""WizOrder"" care provider order entry (CPOE) system. The inpatient care setting provides a unique opportunity to interject CPOE-based decision support features that restructure clinical workflows, deliver focused relevant educational materials, and influence how care is delivered to patients. From their empirical observations, the authors have developed a generic model for decision support within inpatient CPOE systems. They believe that the model's utility extends beyond Vanderbilt, because it is based on characteristics of end-user workflows and on decision support considerations that are common to a variety of inpatient settings and CPOE systems. The specific approach to implementing a given clinical decision support feature within a CPOE system should involve evaluation along three axes: what type of intervention to create (for which the authors describe 4 general categories); when to introduce the intervention into the user's workflow (for which the authors present 7 categories), and how disruptive, during use of the system, the intervention might be to end-users' workflows (for which the authors describe 6 categories). Framing decision support in this manner may help both developers and clinical end-users plan future alterations to their systems when needs for new decision support features arise."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Deterministic projection by growing cell structure networks for visualization of high-dimensionality datasets.	Jason W. H. Wong,Hugh M. Cartwright	2005	Recent advances in clinical proteomics data acquisition have led to the generation of datasets of high complexity and dimensionality. We present here a visualization method for high-dimensionality datasets that makes use of neuronal vectors of a trained growing cell structure (GCS) network for the projection of data points onto two dimensions. The use of a GCS network enables the generation of the projection matrix deterministically rather than randomly as in random projection. Three datasets were used to benchmark the performance and to demonstrate the use of this deterministic projection approach in real-life scientific applications. Comparisons are made to an existing self-organizing map projection method and random projection. The results suggest that deterministic projection outperforms existing methods and is suitable for the visualization of datasets of very high dimensionality.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Artifacts and collaborative work in healthcare: methodological, theoretical, and technological implications of the tangible.	Yan Xiao	2005	Although modeled as knowledge work with emphasis on data flow and decision making, healthcare is delivered in the context of a highly structured physical environment, with much effort and emphasis placed on physical and spatial arrangement and re-arrangement of workers, patients, and materials. The tangible aspects of highly collaborative healthcare work have profound implications for research and development of information and communication technology (ICT) despite the tendency to model work as flow of abstract data items. This article reviews field studies in healthcare and other domains on the role of artifacts in collaborative work and draws implications in three areas: methodological, theoretical, and technological. In regard to methodologies, assessment of new ICT and development of user requirements should take into account how artifacts are used and exploited to facilitate collaborative work. In regard to theories, the framework of distributed cognition provides a starting point for modeling the contribution and exploitation of physical artifacts in supporting collaborative work. In regard to technology, design and deployment of new technology should support the functions provided by physical artifacts replaced or disrupted by new technology, and profitable ways for new technology to support collaborative work by embedding ICT into existing infrastructure of physical artifacts.

Jie Xu,Haiyan Ge,Xiaolin Zhou,Jinglong Yan,Qiang Chi,Zhipeng Zhang	2005	Tissue engineers are often confused on finding the most successful strategy for specific patient. In this study, we used artificial neural networks to predict the outcomes of different vascular tissue engineering strategies, thus providing advisory information for experimental designers. Over 30 variables were used as features of the tissue engineering strategies. Different architectures of artificial neural networks with back propagation algorithm were tested to obtain the best model configuration for the prediction of the tissue engineering strategies. In the computational experiments, the artificial neural networks with one and two hidden layers could, respectively, detect unsuccessful strategies with the highest predictive accuracy of 91.45 and 94.24%. In conclusion, artificial intelligence has great potential in tissue engineering decision support. It can provide accurate advisory information for tissue engineers, thus reducing failures and improving therapeutic effects.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Getting to the point: developing IT for the sharp end of healthcare.	"Christopher P. Nemeth,Mark Nunnally,Michael F. O'Connor,P. A. Klock,Richard I. Cook"	2005	"Healthcare demonstrates the same properties of risk, complexity, uncertainty, dynamic change, and time-pressure as other high hazard sectors including aviation, nuclear power generation, the military, and transportation. Unlike those sectors, healthcare has particular traits that make it unique such as wide variability, ad hoc configuration, evanescence, resource constraints, and governmental and professional regulation. While healthcare's blunt (management) end is more easily understood, the sharp (operator) end is more difficult to research the closer one gets to the sharp end's point. Understanding sharp end practice and cognitive work can improve computer-based systems resilience, which is the ability to perform despite change and challenges. Research into actual practice at the sharp end of healthcare will provide the basis to understand how IT can support clinical practice. That understanding can be used to develop computer-based systems that will act as team players, able to support both individual and distributed cognitive work at healthcare's sharp end."

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Prospective recruitment of patients with congestive heart failure using an ad-hoc binary classifier.	Sergey V. Pakhomov,James D. Buntrock,Christopher G. Chute	2005	This paper addresses a very specific problem of identifying patients diagnosed with a specific condition for potential recruitment in a clinical trial or an epidemiological study. We present a simple machine learning method for identifying patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure and other related conditions by automatically classifying clinical notes dictated at Mayo Clinic. This method relies on an automatic classifier trained on comparable amounts of positive and negative samples of clinical notes previously categorized by human experts. The documents are represented as feature vectors, where features are a mix of demographic information as well as single words and concept mappings to MeSH and HICDA classification systems. We compare two simple and efficient classification algorithms (Naïve Bayes and Perceptron) and a baseline term spotting method with respect to their accuracy and recall on positive samples. Depending on the test set, we find that Naïve Bayes yields better recall on positive samples (95 vs. 86%) but worse accuracy than Perceptron (57 vs. 65%). Both algorithms perform better than the baseline with recall on positive samples of 71% and accuracy of 54%.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Identifying barriers to the effective use of clinical reminders: Bootstrapping multiple methods.	Emily S. Patterson,Bradley N. Doebbeling,Constance H. Fung,Laura G. Militello,Shilo Anders,Steven M. Asch	2005	"Advances in electronic medical record capabilities enable clinical reminders to inform providers when recommended actions are ""due"" for a patient. Despite evidence that they improve adherence to guidelines, the Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) has experienced challenges in having providers consistently use clinical reminders as intended. In this paper, we describe how multiple methods were used to opportunistically triangulate, or ""bootstrap,"" an understanding of barriers to the effective use of clinical reminders in the VHA. In an initial study using ethnographic observations and semi-structured interviews of HIV clinical reminders, we identified six barriers to effective use: workload, time to remove inapplicable reminders, false alarms, training, reduced eye contact, and the use of paper forms rather than software. In a second study, we collected open-ended and closed-ended data regarding barriers and facilitators to the use of clinical reminders in general in the VHA through a survey of 261 participants at a national informatics meeting, where 104 of 142 VHA health care facilities were represented. The findings from the second study extended our understanding of the previously identified barriers. In addition, four new barriers were identified: ease of use issues, accessibility of workstations, resident physicians and trainees, and administration benefiting more than providers from clinical reminder use. We discuss potential implications regarding the similarities and differences in study findings for factors to consider in planning interventions to improve clinical reminder use."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A global goodness-of-fit test for receiver operating characteristic curve analysis via the bootstrap method.	Kelly H. Zou,Frederic S. Resnic,Ion-Florin Talos,Daniel Goldberg-Zimring,Jui G. Bhagwat,Steven Haker,Ron Kikinis,Ferenc A. Jolesz,Lucila Ohno-Machado	2005	Objective. Medical classification accuracy studies often yield continuous data based on predictive models for treatment outcomes. A popular method for evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests is the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The main objective was to develop a global statistical hypothesis test for assessing the goodness-of-fit (GOF) for parametric ROC curves via the bootstrap.Design. A simple log (or logit) and a more flexible Box-Cox normality transformations were applied to untransformed or transformed data from two clinical studies to predict complications following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) and for image-guided neurosurgical resection results predicted by tumor volume, respectively. We compared a non-parametric with a parametric binormal estimate of the underlying ROC curve. To construct such a GOF test, we used the non-parametric and parametric areas under the curve (AUCs) as the metrics, with a resulting p value reported.Results. In the interventional cardiology example, logit and Box-Cox transformations of the predictive probabilities led to satisfactory AUCs (AUC = 0.888; p = 0.78, and AUC = 0.888; p = 0.73, respectively), while in the brain tumor resection example, log and Box-Cox transformations of the tumor size also led to satisfactory AUCs (AUC = 0.898; p = 0.61, and AUC = 0.899; p = 0.42, respectively). In contrast, significant departures from GOF were observed without applying any transformation prior to assuming a binormal model (AUC = 0.766; p = 0.004, and AUC=0.831; p = 0.03), respectively.Conclusions. In both studies the p values suggested that transformations were important to consider before applying any binormal model to estimate the AUC. Our analyses also demonstrated and confirmed the predictive values of different classifiers for determining the interventional complications following PCIs and resection outcomes in image-guided neurosurgery.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Primary care physician time utilization before and after implementation of an electronic health record: A time-motion study.	Lisa Pizziferri,Anne F. Kittler,Lynn A. Volk,Melissa M. Honour,Sameer Gupta,Samuel J. Wang,Tiffany Wang,Margaret Lippincott,Qi Li,David W. Bates	2005	"Despite benefits associated with the use of electronic health records (EHRs), one major barrier to adoption is the concern that EHRs may take longer for physicians to use than paper-based systems. To address this issue, we performed a time-motion study in five primary care clinics. Twenty physicians were observed and specific activities were timed during a clinic session before and after EHR implementation. Surveys evaluated physicians' perceptions regarding the EHR. Post-implementation, the adjusted mean over-all time spent per patient during clinic sessions decreased by 0.5 min (p = 0.86; 95% confidence interval [-5.05, 6.04]) from a preintervention adjusted average of 27.55 min (SE = 2.1) to a post-intervention adjusted average of 27.05 min (SE = 1.6). A majority of survey respondents believed EHR use results in quality improvement, yet only 29% reported that EHR documentation takes the same amount of time or less compared to the paper-based system. While the EHR did not require more time for physicians during a clinic session, further studies should assess the EHR's potential impact on non-clinic time."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Technology, work, and information flows: Lessons from the implementation of a wireless alert pager system.	Madhu C. Reddy,David W. McDonald,Wanda Pratt,M. Michael Shabot	2005	The combination of collaborative work practices and information technology affect the flow of information in clinical settings. The introduction of a new technology into these settings can change not only established work practices but also the information flows. In this paper, we examine the introduction of a wireless alerts pager in a surgical intensive care unit (SICU). Through a qualitative study, we analyze the effects that this new information tool had on both the work practices in the SICU and the information flow in the unit. We describe four challenges that SICU staff members faced with respect to the alerts pagers. We found that the pager provided new routes of information to SICU staff but in doing so disrupted existing work practices and information flows.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Human-centered design of a distributed knowledge management system.	Susan Rinkus,Muhammad F. Walji,Kathy A. Johnson-Throop,Jane T. Malin,James P. Turley,Jack W. Smith,Jiajie Zhang	2005	"Many healthcare technology projects fail due to the lack of consideration of human issues, such as workflow, organizational change, and usability, during the design and implementation stages of a project's development process. Even when human issues are considered, the consideration is typically on designing better user interfaces. We argue that human-centered computing goes beyond a better user interface: it should include considerations of users, functions and tasks that are fundamental to human-centered computing. From this perspective, we integrated a previously developed human-centered methodology with a Project Design Life-cycle, and we applied this integration in the design of a complex distributed knowledge management system for the Biomedical Engineer (BME) domain in the Mission Control Center at NASA Johnson Space Center. We analyzed this complex system, identified its problems, generated systems requirements, and provided specifications of a replacement prototype for effective organizational memory and knowledge management. We demonstrated the value provided by our human-centered approach and described the unique properties, structures, and processes discovered using this methodology and how they contributed in the design of the prototype."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Using qualitative studies to improve the usability of an EMR.	Alan F. Rose,Jeffrey L. Schnipper,Elyse R. Park,Eric G. Poon,Qi Li,Blackford Middleton	2005	"The adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and user satisfaction are closely associated with the system's usability. To improve the usability of a results management module of a widely deployed web-based EMR, we conducted two qualitative studies that included multiple focus group and field study sessions. Qualitative research can help focus attention on user tasks and goals and identify patterns of care that can be visualized through task modeling exercises. Findings from both studies raised issues with the amount and organization of information in the display, interference with workflow patterns of primary care physicians, and the availability of visual cues and feedback. We used the findings of these studies to recommend design changes to the user interface of the results management module."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Evaluation of a pulmonary graphical display in the medical intensive care unit: An observational study.	S. Blake Wachter,Boaz Markewitz,Robert Rose,Dwayne R. Westenskow	2005	We developed a pulmonary graphic display that depicts pulmonary physiological variables for intubated, mechanically ventilated patients in a graphical format. The pulmonary graphical display presents multiple respiratory variables and changes are depicted by alterations in shape and color. Learning how this new technology will be integrated and accepted by users is an important step before it is introduced into the clinical arena. This study observed use and acceptance of the pulmonary graphical display by health care providers in an intensive care unit. Investigators noted that physicians, respiratory therapists, and nurses observed the pulmonary graphical display on average six, three, and one times, respectively, per patient room entry. Based on questionnaires, the pulmonary graphical display was perceived as useful, a desirable addition to current ICU monitors, and an accurate representation of respiratory variables.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	A systems engineering perspective on the human-centered design of health information systems.	George M. Samaras,Richard L. Horst	2005	"The discipline of systems engineering, over the past five decades, has used a structured systematic approach to managing the ""cradle to grave"" development of products and processes. While elements of this approach are typically used to guide the development of information systems that instantiate a significant user interface, it appears to be rare for the entire process to be implemented. In fact, a number of authors have put forth development lifecycle models that are subsets of the classical systems engineering method, but fail to include steps such as incremental hazard analysis and post-deployment corrective and preventative actions. In that most health information systems have safety implications, we argue that the design and development of such systems would benefit by implementing this systems engineering approach in full. Particularly with regard to bringing a human-centered perspective to the formulation of system requirements and the configuration of effective user interfaces, this classical systems engineering method provides an excellent framework for incorporating human factors (ergonomics) knowledge and integrating ergonomists in the interdisciplinary development of health information systems."
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	New probabilistic graphical models for genetic regulatory networks studies.	Junbai Wang,Leo Wang-Kit Cheung,Jan Delabie	2005	This paper introduces two new probabilistic graphical models for reconstruction of genetic regulatory networks using DNA microarray data. One is an independence graph (IG) model with either a forward or a backward search algorithm and the other one is a Gaussian network (GN) model with a novel greedy search method. The performances of both models were evaluated on four MAPK pathways in yeast and three simulated data sets. Generally, an IG model provides a sparse graph but a GN model produces a dense graph where more information about gene-gene interactions may be preserved. The results of our proposed models were compared with several other commonly used models, and our models have shown to give superior performance. Additionally, we found the same common limitations in the prediction of genetic regulatory networks when using only DNA microarray data.
Journal of Biomedical Informatics	Individualizing generic decision models using assessments as evidence.	George C. Scott,Ross D. Shachter	2005	"Complex decision models in expert systems often depend upon a number of utilities and subjective probabilities for an individual. Although these values can be estimated for entire populations or demographic subgroups, a model should be customized to the individual's specific parameter values. This process can be onerous and inefficient for practical decisions. We propose an interactive approach for incrementally improving our knowledge about a specific individual's parameter values, including utilities and probabilities, given a decision model and a prior joint probability distribution over the parameter values. We define the concept of value of elicitation and use it to determine dynamically the next most informative elicitation for a given individual. We evaluated the approach using an example model and demonstrate that we can improve the decision quality by focusing on those parameter values most material to the decision."

Journal of Biomedical Informatics	"A framework for capturing the interactions between laypersons' understanding of disease, information gathering behaviors, and actions taken during an epidemic."	Laura Slaughter,Alla Keselman,André Kushniruk,Vimla L. Patel	2005	"This paper provides a description of a methodological framework designed to capture the inter-relationships between the lay publics' understanding of health-related processes, information gathering behaviors, and actions taken during an outbreak. We developed and refined our methods during a study involving eight participants living in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-affected areas (Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Toronto). The framework is an adaptation of narrative analysis, a qualitative method that is used to investigate a phenomenon through interpretation of the stories people tell about their experiences. From our work, several hypotheses emerged that will contribute to future research. For example, our findings showed that many decisions in an epidemic are carefully considered and involve use of significant information gathering. Having a good model of lay actions based on information received and beliefs held will contribute to the development of more effective information support systems in the event of a future epidemic."
